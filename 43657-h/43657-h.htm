<h2>A PREFACE</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt"><strong>TO BE READ AFTER THE BOOK.</strong></span></p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="dropcap">When, some years ago, I delivered nine lectures
upon the Condition of Woman, I had no
intention of printing them until time had matured
my judgments and justified my conclusions. Peculiar
circumstances afterwards induced me to modify
this decision. The first course of lectures, now
printed as "The College," had proved unexpectedly
popular, and was many times repeated. At its close,
I announced the second course upon Labor, involving
the subject of Prostitution as the result of Low
Wages; and a very unexpected opposition ensued.
My files can still show the large number of letters I
received, beseeching me not to touch this subject; and
private intercession followed, on the part of those I
hold wisest and most dear, to the same effect. Why
I did not yield to all the clamor, I cannot tell,&mdash;except
that I was not working for myself nor <em>of</em>
myself.</p>

<p>I thought it, however, necessary to take unusual
precautions to prevent these lectures from being misunderstood.
I wrote private notes, enclosing tickets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
to almost all the leading clergymen, asking that they
would attend them as a personal favor to myself. I
believe I did not allude to the efforts which had been
made to silence me, except when I wrote to those
who had joined in the outcry. In that case, I demanded
the attendance as an act of justice. These
notes were kindly responded to; and grateful tears
started to my eyes, when I found on the seats before
me white-haired men, who set aside their prejudices
for my sake. Whatever might have been thought
before, the delivery of the lectures silenced all objections.
They were fully attended and frequently repeated;
and I followed the delivery by the printing
of this particular course, in order that misunderstandings
should not have time to establish themselves.
The book was well received, both at home and abroad.
Letters came to me from the far shores of India and
Africa, thanking me for its publication. The first
edition was sold at once; and I should have reprinted
the book, but that I did not wish to re-issue these lectures
in an isolated form. I wanted them reprinted,
if at all, in their proper place, subordinated to my
main thought.</p>

<p>I smile a little as I look back. The remonstrances
upon my file, dated less than ten years ago, would
now be earnestly repudiated by the dear friends who
wrote them.</p>

<p>After the delivery of the third course, upon Law,
local reasons decided the publication of that book.
Many efforts were being made in the different States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
to change laws; and it was thought that the lectures
would give necessary information.</p>

<p>Of the first course, nothing has ever been printed
in this country. The second lecture was printed, by
a sympathizing friend in England, as a tract, and
widely circulated. Part of it was reprinted with
approbation in the "Englishwoman's Journal." The
whole of this course is now given to American readers
in its proper connection, in which it is hoped, that
its bearing upon the later lectures will be seen, and a
new significance given to its suggestions. The history
of these volumes seems to make it necessary to
reprint the original Prefaces in connection with the
lectures on Labor and Law.</p>

<p class="p1">In 1856, I conceived the thought of twelve lectures,
to be written concerning Woman; to embrace,
in four series of three each, all that I felt moved to
say in relation to her interests. No one knew better
than myself that they would be only "twelve baskets
of fragments gathered up;" but I could not distrust
the Divine Love which still feeds the multitudes, who
wander in the desert, with "five loaves and two small
fishes."</p>

<p>In the first three of these lectures, I stated woman's
claim to a civil position, and asked that power should
be given her, under a professedly republican government,
to protect herself. In them I thus stated the
argument on which I should proceed: "The right to
education&mdash;that is, the right to the education or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
drawing-out of all the faculties God has given&mdash;<em>involves</em>
the right to a choice of vocation; that is,
the right to a choice of the end to which those
faculties shall be trained. The choice of vocation
necessarily <em>involves</em> the protection of that vocation,&mdash;the
right to decide how far legislative action shall
control it; in one word, the right to the elective franchise."</p>

<p>Proceeding upon this formula, I delivered, in 1858,
a course of lectures stating "Woman's Claim to
Education;" and this season I have condensed my
thoughts upon the freedom of vocations into the three
following lectures. There are still to be completed
three lectures on "Woman's Civil Disabilities." I
should prefer to unite the twelve lectures in a single
publication; but reasons of imperative force have induced
me to hurry the printing of these "Essays on
Labor." Neither Education nor Civil Disability can
dispute the public interest with this subject. No one
can know better than myself upon what wide information,
what thorough mental discipline, all considerations
in regard to it should be based. I have tried to
keep my work within the compass of my ability, and,
without seeking rigid exactness of detail, to apply
common sense and right reason to problems which
beset every woman's path. At the very threshold of
my work, I confronted a painful task. Before I could
press the necessity of exertion, before I could plead
that labor might be honored in the public eye, I felt
that I must show some cause for the terrible earnestness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
with which I was moved; and I could only
do it by facing boldly the question of "Death or Dishonor?"</p>

<p>"Why not leave it to be understood?" some persons
may object. "Why not leave such work to
man?" the public may continue.</p>

<p>In answer to the first question, I would say, that
very few women have much knowledge of this "perishing
class," except those actually engaged in ministering
to its despair; and that the information I have
given is drawn from wholly reliable sources, as the
reader may see, but can be obtained only by hours&mdash;nay,
days and weeks&mdash;of painful and exhausting
study. Very gladly have I saved my audience that
necessity: greatly have I abbreviated whatever I have
quoted. But I <em>meant</em> to drive home the reality of
that wretchedness: I <em>wanted</em> the women to whom
I spoke to feel for those "in bonds as bound with
them;" and to understand, that to save their own
children, male and female, they must be willing to
save the children of others. It will be observed, that
I have said very little in regard to this class in the
city of Boston; very little, also, that was definite in
regard to our slop-shops. The deficiency is intentional.
I would not have one woman feel that I had
betrayed her confidence, nor one employer that I
had singled him out as a victim; and it is almost
impossible to speak on such subjects without finding
the application made to one's hand. I may say, in
general, that a very wide local experience sustains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
the arguments which I have based on published statistics.</p>

<p>It was also my earnest desire to prepare one article
on this subject that might be put into the hands
of both sexes; that might be opened to the young,
and read in the family circle, without thrilling the
reader with any emotion less sacred than religious
pity. This cannot be true of the reports of any
Moral Reform Society; for in them it is needful to
print details so gross in character as to be fit reading
for none but well-principled persons of mature age.
It is not true of such a work as Dr. Sanger's; for his
historical retrospect furnishes every possible excuse
to the vices of youth, and is open to question on every
page.</p>

<p>From the highest sources in this community&mdash;from
the lips of distinguished clergymen, scholars,
and men of the world&mdash;I have had every private
assurance, that, in this respect, I have not failed.</p>

<p>It would be unjust not to state, that two powerful
causes co-operate, in the city of Boston, with low
wages, to cause the ruin of women; I mean the love
of dress, and a morbid disgust at labor.</p>

<p>The love of dress was a motive which obviously
had no natural relation to my subject. A disinclination
to work, my readers may think, it was proper I
should have treated; but it is the natural reflection
of a state of things, in the upper classes, which would
be a much fitter subject of rebuke.</p>

<p>So long as a lady will allow her guest to stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
exposed to snow and rain, rather than turn the handle
of the door which she happens to be passing; so
long as neither bread nor water can be passed at
table, except at the omnipresent waiter's convenience,&mdash;servants
will naturally think that there is something
degrading and repulsive in work. This reform
must begin in the higher classes.</p>

<p>But, if this subject must be treated at all, why
should it not be left to men? Can women deal with
it abstractly and fairly? The answer is simple. In
physics, no scientific observations are reliable, so
long as they proceed from one quarter alone; many
observers must report, and their observations must
be compared, before we can have a trustworthy result.
So it is in social science. Men have been
dealing with this great evil, unassisted, for thousands
of years. By their own confession, it is as unapproachable
and obstinate as ever. Conquered by its
perpetual re-appearance, they have come to treat it
as an "institution" to be "managed;" not an evil
to be abolished, or a blasphemy to be hushed. But
these lectures are not written for atheists. The
speculative sceptic has retreated before the broad
sunlight of modern civilization: only two classes of
atheists remain,&mdash;men of science, who fancy that
they have lost sight of the Creator in his works, and
talk of the human soul as the most noble result of
material forces; and people of fashion, who live
"without God in the world." Why man should
ever investigate the material universe without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
tender and reverent, nay, a growing dependence on
"the dear heart of God," we will not pause to inquire.
The child does not let go his father's hand
when he first comprehends the abundance of his
resources. Neither the fountains of God's beauty,
nor the perplexities of his nicely ordered law, loosen
man's loving grasp. He clings all the closer in his
joy, because he knows Him better. But why should
not the denizens of the fashionable world be atheists?
When I go among them, and listen to their heartless
fooleries; when I see them absorbed by the vain
nothings of their coterie, rapt in endless consultations
about times and seasons, devoid of any real enjoyment,
hopeless of noble occupation, with the days all
empty and the nights all dark,&mdash;then I, too, shiver
with doubt, and am ready to say in my heart, "There
is no God." We can never believe in any spiritual
reality of which our own souls do not receive some
faint reflex. These people must do the will of the
Father, before they can believe in his love. I do not
write for them, but for thoughtful men and women,
who rejoice in God's presence, deny the permanence
of evil institutions, and are anxious to share with
others the inheritance that belongs to the "child of
the kingdom,"&mdash;for those who have faith to remove
mountains, and courage to confess the faith. For
them I shall not have spoken too plainly.</p>

<p>Shortly after these essays were written,&mdash;in June,
1859,&mdash;I received from London Mrs. Jameson's
"Letter to Lord John Russell;" and I cannot refrain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
from expressing the deep emotion with which I read
what she had written to him upon the same subject.
Well may she wear the silver hairs of her sixty years
like a crown, if, only through their sanction, she may
speak such noble words. But&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>and many a true-hearted woman, far younger in
years, would gladly bear witness with her.</p>

<p>I would not write, if I could, an "exhaustive"
treatise. All I ask for my work is, that it should be
"suggestive." With that purpose, I have worked
out my schemes, in the last lecture, far enough to
provoke objection, to stimulate the spirit of adventure,
to show how easily the "work" may wait upon
the "will." May the "Opening of the Gates" be
near at hand!</p>

<p>It remains only to acknowledge my indebtedness to
some English and American friends: and first to the
"Englishwoman's Journal;" not merely for its own
excellent articles, but for references and suggestions,
most valuable when followed out. The story of the
young straw-braider was drawn from its pages; and,
disappointed in the arrival of original material from
Paris, long expected, I have been compelled to depend
upon it largely for my sketch of Félicie de Fauveau.
To one of its editors, Miss B.R. Parkes, and to
Madame Bodichon in London, as well as to the Rev.
Mr. Higginson, I am under pleasant private obligations.
I must rest content to seem largely indebted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
to the "Edinburgh Review," of April 1859, for condensing
the results of the census. My materials were
collected and arranged, when the article on "Female
Industry" reached me; and the differences in treatment
were so few, that I at once drew my pen
through whatever was not sanctioned by its authority.
The ladies who first directed my attention to
the Waltham watch-factory, and to the inventors of
artificial marble in France, will see from these few
words that I am not forgetful.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;"><span class="smcap">Boston</span>, November, 1859.</span></p>

<p class="p1">There seems, at first sight, a certain presumption in
offering to an American public, at this moment, any
book which does not treat of the great interests which
convulse and perplex the United States. But experience
has shown, that neither the individual nor the
national mind can remain continually upon the rack;
and both author and publisher have thought that a
book upon a serious subject, popular in form and
low in price, would find perhaps a more hearty welcome,
under present circumstances, than in those prosperous
days, when romances and poems, travels and
biographies, were scattered over every table by the
score.</p>

<p>"Woman's Right to Labor" owed its warm welcome,
not to any power or skill in its author, but to
the impatient interest of philanthropists in every
thing relating to that subject. It remains to be seen,
whether as large a portion of the public and the press<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
are prepared to treat with candid consideration the
subject of Law.</p>

<p>Both these volumes have been given to the world
in their detached form, that they might receive the
benefit of general criticism; that errors, inaccuracies,
or misapprehensions, might be perceived and rectified
before they took a permanent position as part of a
larger work. All criticism, therefore, which is <em>honestly
intended</em>, will be received with patience and gratitude;
but a great deal falls to the lot of the author which
cannot come under this head.</p>

<p>If we are told that a "wider acquaintance with the
history" of a certain era will modify our views, it is
natural to expect that an honest critic will show <em>where</em>
the acquaintance fails, and how the views should be
modified. When we are told that certain scientific
illustrations, "though true in the main, are not accurate
in detail," we may reasonably hope to see at
least <em>one</em> error pointed out. When neither of these
things is done, we sweep such remarks aside, as alike
unprofitable to us and our readers.</p>

<p>A wide and generous sympathy in my aims has
given me, thus far, all that I could desire of encouragement
and appreciation; and this appreciation
has come, in several instances, from a "household of
faith" far removed from my own, and has been
mingled in such cases with an outspoken regret, that
one who "wrote so well, and felt so warmly," should
not acknowledge on her pages the debt woman owes
to Christianity, and unfurl an evangelical banner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
above a Christ-like work. Because such friends
have spoken tenderly, I answer them respectfully;
because I never saw any church-door so narrow
that I could not pass through it, nor so wide that it
would open to all God's glory, I answer them without
fear.</p>

<p>And, first, I believe in God, as the tender Father
of all; as one who cares for the least of his children,
and does not turn from the greatest; as one whose
eye marks the smallest inequalities of happiness or
condition, and holds them in a memory which does
not fail. I believe in Christ as his authorized
Teacher, anointed to reveal the fulness of God's love
through his own life of practical good-will. I do not
expect him to be superseded or set aside; and I do
expect, that in proportion as men grow wiser, humbler,
and sweeter, their eyes will open only the more widely
to the great miracle of his spotless life, to the heavenly
nature of his so simple teachings. And, next, I
believe in my own work,&mdash;the elevation of woman
through education, which is development; through
labor, which is salvation; through legal rights, which
are only freedom to develop and save,&mdash;as part of
the mission of Jesus on the earth, authorized by him,
inspired of God, and sure of fulfilment as any portion
of his law. If at any time I have lost sight of this
in expression, it is because I have thought it impossible
that the purpose and character of my work
should be mistaken. I am a slow and patient worker,&mdash;patient,
because one may well be patient, if God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
can; and therefore no disappointment, no lack of
appreciation, could sour or disturb me.</p>

<p>If I have justified the publication of this essay at
the present moment, it may be thought that I shall not
be able to justify the principal presumption; namely,
that of a woman who undertakes to write upon law.</p>

<p>Such a treatise as this would be valueless, in my
eyes, if it were written by a man. It is a woman's
judgment in matters that concern women that the
world demands, before any radical change can be
made. To understand the laws under which I must
live, no recondite learning, no broad scholarship, no
professional study, can be fitly required. Common
intelligence and common sense are all that society
has any right to claim of me. Because most women
shrink from criticising this law, I have criticised it.</p>

<p>Very recently, the "London Quarterly" said, in
speaking of the republication of John Austin's work,
that "English jurisprudence would be indebted for
one of its highest aids to the reverential affection of a
wife, and the patient industry of a refined and
intelligent woman;" and Mrs. Austin defends her
undertaking on this very ground,&mdash;that, if she had
not superintended the work, <em>no one else would</em>. If
John Austin's firm and penetrating intellect could not
hold a score of persons about his lecturer's desk, and
if it found its fit appreciation only in the grave, a
conscientious woman need not shrink from any
branch of his great subject, only because her audience
will be small.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span></p>

<p>In one of his lectures upon Art, John Ruskin
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Every leaf we have seen, connects its work with the
entire and accumulated result of the work of its predecessors.
Dying, it leaves its own small but well-labored
thread; adding, if imperceptibly, yet essentially, to the
strength, from root to crest, of the trunk on which it has lived,
and fitting that trunk for better service to the next year's
foliage."</p></blockquote>

<p>Let these words, printed on my titlepage, show
the modesty of my aim, and the conscientious steadfastness
of my purpose. As the leaf is to the tree, so
is the individual to society. Tear away a single leaf
from the towering crest, and the trunk does not seem
to suffer: nevertheless, one small thread withers, one
channel dries up, one source of beauty and use fails;
and, from that moment, a certain sidewise tendency
marks the growth.</p>

<p>To compact carefully one "well-labored thread," is
all that I have sought to do,&mdash;to write a little book,
that women might be won to read, as conscientiously
as if it were a heavy tome, to be endlessly consulted
by the bench.</p>

<p>In writing these three lectures, I feel quite sure that
I must have made use of many significant expressions
borrowed from those who have broken the way for
me. For many years an extemporaneous lecturer on
this and kindred topics, I have so wrought certain
modes of expression into the fabric of my thought,
that I do not <em>know</em> where to put my quotation-marks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
To Mrs. Hugo Reed, for instance, I know I must be
under great obligations; and I can only hope, that
she will trust me with her thoughts and words as
generously as I desire to trust all my readers with
mine. It is little matter who does the work, so that
it be done; but I owe to one author, in particular,
something like an explanation.</p>

<p>A few days before the third of these lectures was
delivered in Boston (that is, before Jan. 23, 1861),
a gentleman from Paris brought me from Madame
d'Héricourt a book called "La Femme Affranchie,"
an answer to Michelet, Proudhon, Girardin, and
Comte, which its author kindly desired I should translate
for the American market. Unable to comply
with her request, some weeks elapsed before I opened
the book. I was struck with the energy, self-possession,
and rapidity with which she seized the various
points of the subject, with the thoroughness of her
assault, and the temper of her argument. I did not
sympathize in all her methods or conclusions; but I
was interested to observe, that, in what I had then
written and publicly spoken of the relations between
suffrage and humanity, I had, in several instances,
used her very words, or she had used mine. I did
not alter my manuscript; but, with better times, we
may hope for a translation of her spirited volumes, and
the public will then do justice to her precedence.</p>

<p>I have been anxious to have positive proof of my
conjecture in regard to the authorship of the "Lawe's
Resolution of the Rights of Women;" but persevering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
endeavors in England, in several directions, have
only left the matter as it stands in the text. It would
be very interesting to know something of the private
history of the man who wrote that book.</p>

<p>In the first of the following lectures, I have ventured
a rhetorical allusion to the blue-laws of Connecticut.
Since it went to press, I have seen it stated,
on high authority, that any American writer who
should "profess to believe in the existence of the blue-laws
of New Haven would simply proclaim himself
a dunce;" and the "Saturday Review" has been
handled without gloves for taking this existence for
granted.</p>

<p>I never supposed that the term "blue" applied
to the color of the paper on which such laws were
printed, any more than I supposed "blue Presbyterianism"
referred to the color of the presbyters'
gowns. I supposed it was the outgrowth of a popular
sarcasm, descriptive, not of a "veritable code,"
nor of a "practical code unpublished," but of such
portions of the general code as were repugnant to
common sense, and the genial nature of man. This
I still think will be found to be the case; and it is
certainly to Connecticut divines and Connecticut
newspapers that we owe the popular impression.</p>

<p>It was in the forty-sixth year of the independence
of the United States that S. Andrus &amp; Co., of Hartford,
published a volume purporting to be a compendium
of early judicial proceedings in Connecticut,
and especially of that portion of the proceedings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
the Colony of New Haven commonly called the
"blue-laws." Charles A. Ingersoll, Esq., testified to
the correctness of these copies of the ancient record.</p>

<p>As I quote this title wholly from memory, I am
unable to say whether the colony ever fined a bishop
for kissing his own wife on Sunday; but I have read
more than once of such fines; and, if no laws remain
unrepealed on the Connecticut statute-book quite as
absurd in their spirit and general tendency, there are
many on those of Massachusetts and New Hampshire:
so I shall let my rhetorical flourish stand.</p>

<p>To my English friends, to Mr. Herndon of Illinois,
Mr. Higginson, and Samuel F. Haven, Esq., of Worcester,
I owe my usual acknowledgments for books
lent, and service proffered, with a generosity and
graceful readiness cheering to remember.</p>

<p>Nor will I omit, in what may be a last opportunity,
to bear faithful testimony to the assistance rendered,
in all my studies of this sort, by my friend, Mr. John
Patton, of Montreal. No single person has helped
me so much, so wisely, or so well.</p>

<p>In order to secure technical accuracy, my manuscript
and proofs have been subjected to the revision of my
friend, the Hon. Samuel E. Sewall. The principal
alteration which Mr. Sewall has made, has been the
substitution of the word "suffrage" for that of "franchise;"
which latter I used in the Continental fashion.
I prefer it to "suffrage," because it seems to have a
broader signification; but I yield it to his suggestion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span></p>

<p>I would gladly have dedicated this volume to the
memory of the late John W. Browne, whose pure
purpose and eminent gifts made me rejoice, while he
was living, to call him friend. As, however, he never
read the whole of the manuscript, I have given it a
dedication "to the friends of forsaken women," which
no one, who knew him well, will fail to perceive includes
him.</p>

<p class="dropcap">TO propose an essay on education requires no
little courage; for the term has covered, with its
broad mantle, every thing that is stupid, perverse,
and oppressive in literature. We will not tax ourselves,
however, to consider exact theories, or suggest
formal dissertations. In these lectures, let us take all
the liberties of conversation; pass, in brief review, a
wide range of subjects; comment lightly, not thoroughly,
upon them; and trust to quick sympathies
and intelligent apprehension to follow out any really
useful suggestions that may be made.</p>

<p>Some time since, we laid down this proposition:
"A man's right to education&mdash;that is, to the education
or drawing-out of all the faculties God has given
him&mdash;involves the right to a choice of vocation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
that is, to a choice of the end to which those faculties
shall be trained. The choice of vocation involves the
right and the duty of protecting that vocation; that
is, the right of deciding how far it shall be taxed, in
how many ways legislative action shall be allowed to
control it; in one word, the right to the elective franchise."</p>

<p>This statement we made in the broadest way;
applying it to the present condition of women, and
intending to show, that, the moment society conceded
the right to education, it conceded the whole question,
unless this logic could be disputed.</p>

<p>Men of high standing have been found to question
a position seemingly so impregnable, but only on the
ground that republicanism is itself a failure, and that
it is quite time that Massachusetts should insist upon
a property qualification for voters.</p>

<p>In this State, so remarkable for its intelligence and
mechanical skill,&mdash;a State which has sent regiment
after regiment to the battle-field, armed by the college,
rather than the court,&mdash;in this State, one somewhat
eminent voice has been heard to whisper, that <em>men</em>
have not this right to education; that the lower classes
in this country are fatally injured by the advantages
offered them; that they would be happier, more contented,
and more useful, if left to take their chance,
or compelled to pay for the reading and writing which
their employers, in some kinds, might require.</p>

<p>We need not be sorry that these objections are so
stated. They are a fair sample of all the objections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
that obtain against the legal emancipation of <em>woman</em>,
an emancipation which Christ himself intended and
prophesied,&mdash;speaking always of his kingdom as
one in which no distinctions of sex should either be
needed or recognized. Push any objector to the
wall, and he will be compelled to shift his attitude.
He says nothing more about women, but shields himself
under the old autocratic pretension, that man,
collectively taken, has <em>no</em> right to life, liberty, or the
pursuit of happiness; that republicanism itself is a
failure.</p>

<p>Our hearts need not sink in view of this assertion,
apparently sustained by a civil war that fixes the suspicious
eyes of autocratic Europe in sullen suspense.
A republic, whose foundations were laid in usurpation,
could not expect to stand, till it had, with its own
right arm, struck off its "feet of clay." It is not freedom
which fails, but slavery.</p>

<p>The course of the world is not retrograde. Massachusetts
will not call a convention to insist upon a
property qualification for voters, neither will she close
her schoolhouses, nor forswear her ancient faith. The
time shall yet come when she shall free herself from
reproach, and fulfil the prophetic promise of her republicanism,
by generous endowment for her women,
and the open recognition of their citizenship.</p>

<p>It is not our purpose, however, to dwell upon facilities
of school education. More conservative speakers
will plead, eloquently as we could wish, in that behalf;
and suggestions on other topics need to be made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>We have already said, that the educational rights
of women are simply those of all human beings,&mdash;namely,
"the right to be taught all common branches
of learning, a sufficient use of the needle, and any
higher branches, for which they shall evince either
taste or inclination; the right to have colleges, schools
of law, theology, and medicine open to them; the
right of access to all scientific and literary collections,
to anatomical preparations, historical records, and rare
manuscripts."</p>

<p>And we do not make this claim with any particular
theory as to woman's powers or possibilities. She
may be equal to man, or inferior to him. She may
fail in rhetoric, and succeed in mathematics. She
may be able to bear fewer hours of study. She may
insist on more protracted labor. What we claim is,
that no one knows, as yet, what women are, or what
they can do,&mdash;least of all, those who have been
wedded for years to that low standard of womanly
achievement, which classical study tends to sustain.
Because we do not know, because experiment is
necessary, we claim that all educational institutions
should be kept open for her; that she should be
encouraged to avail herself of these, according to her
own inclination; and that, so far as possible, she
should pursue her studies, and test her powers, in
company with man. We do not wish her to follow
<em>any</em> dictation; not ours, nor another's. We ask for
her a freedom she has never yet had. There is,
between the sexes, a law of incessant, reciprocal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
action, of which God avails himself in the constitution
of the family, when he permits brothers and
sisters to nestle about one hearth-stone. Its ministration
is essential to the best educational results. Our
own educational institutions should rest upon this
divine basis. In educating the sexes together under
fatherly and motherly supervision,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> we avail ourselves
of the highest example; and the result will be
a simplicity, modesty, and purity of character, not so
easy to attain when general abstinence from each
other's society makes the occasions of re-union a
period of harmful excitement. Out of it would come
a quick perception of mutual proprieties, delicate
attention to manly and womanly habits, refinement
of feeling, grace of manner, and a thoroughly symmetrical
development. If the objections which are
urged against this&mdash;the divine fashion of training
men and women to the duties of life&mdash;were well
founded, they would have been felt long ago in those
district schools, attended by both sexes, which are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
pride of New England. The classes recently opened
by the Lowell Institute, under the control of the
Institute of Technology, are an effort in the right
direction, for which we cannot be too grateful. Heretofore,
every attempt to give advanced instruction to
women has failed. Did a woman select the most
accomplished instructor of men, and pay him the
highest fee, she could not secure thorough tuition.
He taught her without conscience in the higher
branches; for he took it upon himself to assume that
she would never put them to practical use. He
treated her desire for such instruction as a caprice,
though she might have shown her appreciation by
the distinct bias of her life. We claim for women a
share of the opportunities offered to men, because we
believe that they will never be thoroughly taught
until they are taught at the same time and in the
same classes.</p>

<p>The most mischievous errors are perpetuated by
drawing masculine and feminine lines in theory at
the outset. The God-given impulse of sex, if left
in complete freedom, will establish, in time, certain
distinctions for itself; but these distinctions should
never be pressed on any individual soul. Whether
man or woman, each should be left free to choose
its own methods of development. We pause, therefore,
to show, that, when we spoke of a certain use
of the needle as a matter to be taught to both
sexes, we did so by no inadvertence. The use of
the sewing machine is even now common to both;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
but men, as well as women, should be taught to use
their fingers for common purposes skilfully. Personal
contact with the pauperism of large cities has
sent this conviction home to many practical minds.</p>

<p>The rough tippets, mittens, and socks imported
into the British Colonies, are the work of the Welsh
farmers and the Shetland fishermen during the long
tempestuous winter nights. In writing to Lady
Holland, Sidney Smith pens some pleasant words
on this subject.</p>

<p>"I wish I could sew," he says. "I believe one
reason why women are so much more cheerful than
men is because they can work, and so vary their
employments. Lady &mdash;&mdash; used to teach her boys
carpet-work. All men ought to learn to sew."</p>

<p>All men! and so might the cares of many women
be lightened. Let us candidly confess our own
indebtedness to the needle. How many hours of
sorrow has it softened, how many bitter irritations
calmed, how many confused thoughts reduced to
order, how many life-plans sketched in purple!</p>

<p>Let us pass over that portion of our statement
which hints at vocation, and confine ourselves, for
the present, to that part of it which looks to an
unrestricted mental culture. Nowhere is this systematically
denied to women. It is quite common to
hear people say, "There is no need to press that subject.
Education in New England is free to women.
In Bangor, Portsmouth, Newburyport, and Boston,
they are better Latin scholars than the men. Nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
can set this stream back: turn and labor elsewhere."</p>

<p>We have shown to how very small an extent this
statement is true. If it were true of the mere means
of education, education itself is not won for woman,
till it brings to her precisely the same blessings that
it bears to the feet of man; till it gives her honor,
respect, and bread; till position becomes the rightful
inheritance of capacity, and social influence follows
a knowledge of mathematics and the languages.
Our deficiency in the last stages of the culture
offered to our women made a strong impression
on a late Russian traveller.</p>

<p>"Is that the best you can do?" said Mr. Kapnist,
when he came out of the Mason-street Normal
School for Girls. "It is very poor. In Russia, we
should do better. At Cambridge, you have eminent
men in every kind,&mdash;Agassiz, Gray, Peirce. Why
do they not lecture to these women? In Russia,
they would go everywhere,&mdash;speak to both sexes.
At a certain age, recitation is the very poorest way
of imparting knowledge."</p>

<p>To all adult minds, lectures convey instruction
more happily than recitation; and, when men and
women are taught together, the lecture system is
valuable, because it permits the mind to appropriate
its own nutriment, and does not oppress the
faculties with uncongenial food.</p>

<p>To those who are familiar with the whole question,
no theme is more painful than that of the inadequate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
compensation and depressed position of
the female teacher. There is no need to harp on
this discordant string. Let us strike its key-note
in a single story.</p>

<p>A year ago, in one of the most beautiful towns
of this neighborhood, separated by a grassy common,
shaded with drooping elms, rose two ample buildings,
dedicated to the same purpose. They were
the High Schools for the two sexes.</p>

<p>They were taught by two persons, admirably fitted
for their work. The man, uncommonly happy in
imparting instruction, was yet deficient in mathematics,
and considered by competent judges inferior
to the woman.</p>

<p><em>She</em> was an orphan, with a young sister dependent
upon her for instruction and support. She had been
graduated with the highest honors at one of the
State Normal Schools. She was delicate and beautiful;
not in the least "strong-minded." Neither
spectacles upon her nose, nor wooden soles to her
boots, appealed to the popular indignation. All who
knew her loved her; and the man whom we have
named was not ashamed to receive instruction from
her in geometry and algebra. The two schools
were equal in numbers. The man was a bachelor,
subject to no claim beyond his own necessity.
What did common sense and right reason demand,
but that these two persons should be treated alike by
society, prudential committees, and so on? You shall
hear what was the fact. The man was engaged at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
a salary of fifteen hundred dollars. The wealthiest
class in the community intrusted its sons to his
charge without question. Single, he was made much
of in society, invited to parties, and had his own corner
at many a tea-table, which he brightened with his
pleasant jokes. He soon came to be a person in
the town,&mdash;had his vote, was valued accordingly;
went to church, was put upon committees, had a
great deal to do with calling the new minister, and
so, out of school, had pleasant and varied occupation,
which saved his soul from racking to death
over the ruts of the Latin grammar. Would we
have it otherwise? Was it not all right? Certainly
it was, and our friend deserved it; deserved, too, that
when the second year was half over, and there were
rumors that a distant city had secured his services,
the committee should raise his salary two hundred
and fifty dollars, and so keep him for themselves.
But let us look at the reverse of the picture. The
woman, burdened with the care of a younger sister,
greatly this man's superior in mathematics and possibly
in other things, was engaged at six hundred
dollars. It was not customary for the wealthy families
in that neighborhood to trust their girls to the
tender mercies of a public school; so she had a
class of pupils less elegant in manner, of more ordinary
mental training, and every way more difficult
to control. Still they were disciplined, and learned
to love their teacher. A few of the parents called
upon her, and she was occasionally invited to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
homes. But these homes were not congenial to her
tastes or habits. There was no intellectual stimulus
derived from them to brighten her life. They
offered neither pictures, statues, books, nor the results
of travel, to her delicate and yearning appreciation.
She talked, for the most part, of her pupils
and their work; and the strain of her vocation, always
heavier on woman than on man, wore more and
more upon her soul. Society, as such, offered her
no welcome.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p><em>She</em> was nothing to the town. She hired her seat,
and went to church. She had no vote, was never on
a parish committee, had only one chance to change
her position. That was to remove to a more congenial
neighborhood, at a lower salary; but she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
thought of her young sister, and refused. If the committee
heard of it, they did not offer to increase her
salary. They were men incapable of appreciating her
rare and modest culture. There was a tendency to
consumption in her frame. Had she been happy, she
might have resisted it for years, perhaps for ever; but
with the restless pining at her heart, that mental and
moral marasmus, the physical disease soon showed
itself. In the commencement of the third year of her
teaching, she began to cough; and, in less than three
months from the day when she heard her last class,
she lay in an early but not unhonored grave. The
deep affection of her classmates in the Normal
School had always followed her; and one who
chanced to hear of her illness brightened its rapid
decline. This woman, herself prematurely old, in
consequence of twelve years of labor on the Red
River of Louisiana, the only place open to her, where
her abilities were appreciated to the extent of twelve
hundred dollars a year, and would enable her to support
a widowed mother,&mdash;this woman, with her now-scanty
purse, supplied the invalid with fresh flowers
and sweet pictures; and, when her heavy eye grew
weary of gazing, gently closed it in the sleep of
death, scattered rare and fragrant blossoms over her
unconscious form, and followed it to the grave.
Those flowers! brought daily to her teacher's-desk
by a friendly or loving hand, they might have fed a
craving heart, and saved a precious life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>It is no new story. You have heard it many times.
Do not reply in the stale maxims of political economy.
Do not say that woman's labor is cheaper than
man's, because it is more abundant. Unskilled labor,
we will grant you, is more abundant; but such labor
as is here offered must always be rare and valuable.
To the applicants who came to fill her vacant place
the committee said, "We do not expect to find another
capable as she was. We have only to select one that
<em>will do</em>." Yet they had not been ashamed to use
that capacity without paying for it! Only ignorance
and prejudice and custom stood in the way of its
appreciation; only the want of that respect which a
citizen can always command was at the bottom of
her social isolation. She never complained; but we
complain for her, sadly conscious, that, until men
themselves perceive what is fit, the remonstrances of
women will be fruitless. One such word as that
spoken by the Hon. Joseph White at Framingham,
in July, 1864, is worth more than all that women can
say. Nevertheless, we women have our duty. It is
to convince and stimulate men. Be on the watch,
then, for such women; and claim for them their place
and remuneration. Help society to understand its
duty, to be frank and honorable. And if certain
services are worth, as in this case, seventeen hundred
and fifty dollars a year, pay for equal services, <em>by
whomsoever rendered</em>, an equal sum.</p>

<p>Since I first began to speak upon this subject, a very
great change has taken place: women are put in places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
which require higher culture and greater administrative
capacity. They are also paid better wages: these
wages are not yet in fair proportion to what are paid
to men for the same work; and the shameful argument
is still used, that we employ women, chiefly
because men will not work for the same price. The
Roxbury High School, the Shurtleff Grammar School
in Chelsea, the Normal School at St. Louis, and
the Normal School at Framingham, are now under
the charge of women. In the list of teachers from the
Oswego School, we find four who are paid one
thousand dollars a year, and eleven who are paid
seven hundred dollars. Our daily press is very well
satisfied with this; but, since 1860, what portion of a
decent living will seven hundred dollars provide to
a cultivated woman? When the salaries of the St.
Louis teachers were raised in 1866, the principal was
obliged to express her indignation before her salary
was raised to its present sum of two thousand dollars.
Had she been a man, she would certainly have had
as much as the principal of the High School; namely,
twenty-seven hundred and fifty dollars. A graduate
of Antioch College, assisting in the High School at St.
Louis, has twelve hundred dollars, where a man
would have seventeen hundred dollars. Miss Brackett's
own assistants in the Normal School have eleven
hundred dollars.</p>

<p>The appointment of Miss Johnson to the head of
the Normal School at Framingham will open the
way to a similar change in many quarters, if what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Governor Bullock has not disdained to call the "policy
of Massachusetts" is consistently carried out. I do
not know what salary is offered to Miss Johnson;
but, if it were equal to that of the man who preceded
her, would not the newspapers have told us? The
comparative value of these salaries is not shown by
the figures. It depends on the prices of gold, and of
food and provisions, each year. It cannot be half as
great as an inexperienced person would think.</p>

<p>There is a great want of female teachers of Latin
and French. School committees assure me, that proficients
in language would be certain of good pay in
our high schools. For the most part, women prefer
to devote themselves to mathematics. I used to say,
with a smile, in the Western States, that all the women
could read the "Mécanique Céleste;" but they found
Cæsar and Télémaque equally uninteresting. Later,
Colonel Higginson bears witness to the impossibility
of getting good classical teachers.</p>

<p>It is a common idea, that the standard of education
is higher now than it was thirty years ago. It may
be doubted. More things are taught in schools,&mdash;ologies,
isms, and the like; but the most thorough
teachers are not the most popular, and it may be
questioned, whether in the best minds on the Continent,
in England, or this country, so great progress
has been made as has been generally claimed. There
is much more liberality in regard to the general question,
but no more in regard to the ideal standard.</p>

<p>In one of Niebuhr's letters to Madame Hensler,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
he says, in speaking of Klopstock: "The character
of the women is a remarkable feature of the time
of Klopstock's youth. The cultivation of the mind
was carried incomparably farther with them than
with nearly all the young women of our days; and
this we should scarcely have expected to find in the
cotemporaries of our grandmothers. It was not,
therefore, the influence of our native literature; for
that first rose into being along with, and under the
influence of, the love inspired by these charming
maidens. For some time after the Thirty Years' War,
the ladies of Germany, particularly those of the middle
classes, were excessively coarse and uneducated.
This wonderful alteration must have taken place,
therefore, during eighty years,&mdash;between 1660 and
1740; though we are quite ignorant how and when
it began."</p>

<p>Passing over to France, we encounter the reputation
of Madame de Sablé; a woman, let me remark,
for the benefit of those who are afraid that the march
of education will deprive them of their dinners, as
celebrated for her exquisite cooking and delicate
confections as she was for her literary ability. In
speaking of her, Cousin says: "All the literature of
maxims and thoughts, including those of La Rochefoucauld,
grew up in the <em>salon</em> of a lovely woman
withdrawn into a convent. Having no earthly pleasure
but that of reliving her life, she knew how to impart
her own taste to society, in which she met by
chance an accomplished wit, whom she contrived to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
turn into a great writer." He is speaking of the
early part of the seventeenth century; and, in spite of
the notorious dissipation of the period, many gifted
and many virtuous women crowded her <em>salon</em>,&mdash;the
Princess Palatine, the Princesses of Condé, de Conti,
de Longueville, and Schomberg, Anna de Rohan, and
Mademoiselle herself. There the gentlemen carried
the pages they wrote at home, and not only bore with,
but accepted, the criticisms of the women. They had
no compensation but their praises, unless, like La
Rochefoucauld, they were cunning enough to demand
a carrot pottage or some preserved plums in exchange
for a page of literature. In England, it is not necessary
to avail ourselves of an exceptional education,
like that of Lady Jane Grey. Remembering the
noble culture of Elizabeth Tudor and Mary Stuart,
of the sturdy women of the Commonwealth, we
might surely expect a greater progress in the national
idea. But, if its average could be found, neither the
wife of John Hampden nor Lady Russell would accept
it. It would seem that our standard advances,
if at all, by a series of Hugh Miller's parabolic curves.
What we find, depends upon the point at which we
happen to test the eccentric arc; and, when we enter
the nineteenth century, we are forced to take refuge
in analogy, and ask, "If the ancient Egyptians <em>ever</em>
mastered the Copernican idea, why should Galileo
be imprisoned to-day for insisting that the sun does
not move round the earth?" The stimulating examples
of noble and educated women, which now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
present themselves, do not cheer us as they should,
while they remain exceptions. In making what Dickens
would call an "indiscriminate and incontinent"
excursion, into the regions of female thought and
literature, we find its atmosphere in a somewhat
unventilated condition, and are reminded of an
opinion of the Druses which does not seem to have
been wholly impertinent, that "literature is a mean
and contemptible occupation, <em>fit only for women</em>."
Twenty years ago, when ties of an almost filial tenderness
linked us to the household of the late Judge
Cranch, we have often followed him, unrecognized, of
a Saturday afternoon, when, returning from the bench,
he climbed Capitol Hill, one hand grasping the handle
of some colored washerwoman's basket, or slinging
her heavy bundle over his shoulder on a stick. The
dear remembrance, sustained by all the sweet and
delicate courtesies of his private life, has always
lain side by side in our mind with that exquisite
Essay of Elia to which he first directed our attention,
in which a noble reverence to woman is inculcated,
and we are taught to judge every man's respect
for the sex by his demeanor towards its humblest
representative. Yet, if Judge Cranch never swerved
from his gracious dignity, Charles Lamb did. Woman
had not gained, in his lifetime, such a hold upon
her intellectual rights, that a dinner company dared
chide him, when he said of Letitia Landon, "If she
belonged to me, I would lock her up, and feed her on
bread and water, till she gave up writing poetry. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
female poet, or female author of any kind, ranks below
an actress, <em>I</em> think."</p>

<p>We do not quote these words so much against
Lamb himself,&mdash;for the lips of Mary Lamb's brother
must have been thick with wine, when, with "stammering,
insufficient sound," he included her in so
sweeping a reprobation,&mdash;but to indicate the nature
of that public opinion which is even now dwarfing
the ideals of the best men; to show how little reliance
is to be placed on the standard of the most
generous, when a remark like this, uttered in a large
literary circle, passes without criticism, and is recorded
without conscious mortification,&mdash;recorded, too,
by the father of that Coventry Patmore, who has
known how to offer us, in later times, sugar-plums of
his own <em>coloring</em>&mdash;let us add of his own <em>poisoning</em>
also&mdash;under the alluring names of "betrothals" and
"espousals." How far the <em>facts</em> are from the ideal
standard, Mrs. Jameson, in a lecture lately delivered,
will help us to show.</p>

<p>"With all our schools," she says, "of all denominations,
it remains an astounding fact, that <em>one-half</em>
of the women who annually become <em>wives</em>, in this
England of ours, cannot sign their names in the parish
register; and that this amount of ignorance in
the lower classes is accompanied with an amount of
ill-health, despondency, inaptitude, and uselessness in
the so-called educated classes, which, taken together,
prove that our boasted appliances are to a great extent
failures."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The ancient standard of Italy was very high, even
in the fifteenth century, if we consider only the literary
skill or mathematical culture frequently desired
and attained; but Anna Maria Mozzoni may congratulate
herself on having given a moral and
social impetus to it, which it has never before received.
Her wise, considerate, philosophical suggestions will
meet the cordial welcome of all right-minded women.
If followed out, they will create nobler women than
Tambroni or Laura Veratti.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>There was no institution in England for the proper
training of sick nurses, when Florence Nightingale
went to Kaiserworth, a small town near Düsseldorf,
on the Rhine, to prepare herself to take charge of the
Female Sanitorium. In Great Britain, at this moment,
the excess of the female population over the
male amounts to five hundred thousand souls; and
from all directions we hear the cry, that <em>men</em> need
educated assistants. What is the country doing to
answer this cry, to educate her five hundred thousand
women? In 1825 Dr. Gooch made a noble appeal
to the English public, in behalf of educating women
to be nurses; but there was no response. When the
first school of design was started, a petition was drawn
up and <em>signed</em>, praying that women might not be
taught, at the expense of the Government, arts which
would interfere with the employment of men, and
"take the bread out of <em>their</em> mouths"!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Here was an absurd interference with the right of
<em>feeding</em>, on the part of these petitioners! As if women
did not want bread as well as men; and being,
according to authority, the less intelligent and weaker
sex, one would suppose that to help them to find it
might be a part of that protection to which the Government
stands pledged, and for which their property is
taxed.</p>

<p>"But," says Mrs. Jameson, "if a petition were
drawn up, and handed to medical men, praying that
women should not be trained as nurses, nor taught
the laws of health, I am afraid there are well-intentioned
men, who would, at the time, be induced to
sign it; but I believe that twenty, nay, even ten years
hence, they would look back upon their signatures
with as much disgust and amazement as is now excited
by the attempt to explode and sneer down the
school at Marlborough House."</p>

<p>Another noble English woman, Mrs. Barbara Leigh
Bodichon, in a recent pamphlet called "Woman and
Work," gives us the correspondence between Jessie
Meriton White and the various medical schools to
which she applied for admission. This lady had for
several years had charge of two little lame children,
one of them her own nephew. The latter, on account
of some structural defect, had broken his leg sixteen
times. Once, when suitable attendance was not to
be had, his aunt set and splintered it herself. The
physician who examined it advised her to apply for
instruction. She applied to fourteen medical institutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in the city of London, asking sometimes for
<em>private</em> anatomical instruction. The correspondence
with four colleges in the year 1856 is given,&mdash;from
the St. George's, the Royal College of Surgeons, St.
Bartholomew's Hospital, and the University of London.
It amply bears out her assertion, that she was
nowhere met with solid objections, or with sensible
and logical replies. Sometimes she was told of the <em>indelicacy</em>
of her request! The University of London,
which was legally bound by its charter to receive her,
treated her as coolly as the rest; and in no case was
any individual regret expressed for the official decision.</p>

<p>Indelicacy, forsooth! Where can we find it, if not
in the impure nature which raises the objection, and
the low manner of thinking in general society which
consents to receive it? May not the mother, who receives
her naked new-born child from the hand of
God, fitly ask to understand the liabilities of its little
frame? May not the wife, called in seasons of sickness
to the most delicate and trying duties, modestly
ask for that thorough culture which alone can make
those duties easy? And who make this objection?
Men who go shuddering and half-drunken into the
dissecting room, to scatter vile jests above that prostrate
temple of the Holy Ghost! Men who see
nothing in the exquisite development of God's creation,
but the reflection of their own obscene lives!
Students who know no better way to steel their
courage to the use of the scalpel than to play at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
foot-ball on the college green with a human skull,
holding its dignity to the level of their own honor!<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The best hope that Jessie Meriton White has for
England is, that some of the most distinguished professors
shall consent in time to take classes of female
students.</p>

<p>The office of the physician is as holy as that of the
priest: formerly they were one; now, at least, the
physician should be priest-like. Irreverence and impurity
should be banished from medical ranks. The
science of medicine stands in great need of the intuitive
genius of woman. In pursuing it, she will
need the steady caution of man. In this country and
in France, earnest and devoted students of both sexes
have stood in the dissecting room to the benefit of
both. So let them continue to stand, till the spirit is
known by its fruits. An impure man is no better
than an impure woman; but impurity among men
may be concealed. Let it come between the two
sexes, and it will be brought at once into antagonism
with society, and will meet its true desert. The objection
reveals the secrets of the medical college, and is
the strongest argument ever offered for the medical
education of women.</p>

<p>If women are to practise as physicians, some means
should be taken to protect society against those who
are imperfectly educated. <em>What a degree means</em> will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
always be doubtful, until men and women receive
their degrees in the same way and from the same
hands. America stands greatly in need of this protection.
Crowds of unauthorized, half-educated women,
some of whom have not been ashamed to cross
the Atlantic, and have attracted such sympathy
abroad as only a different class of students deserve,
are thronging the valley of the Mississippi, as well as
haunting with their empirical pretensions the purlieus
of the seaboard cities. If men had received properly
trained women into their colleges and medical societies,
this would not have happened. Cannot such
physicians as Dr. Zakrzewska, Dr. Blackwell, Dr.
Sewall, Dr. Tyng, and Dr. Ross of Milwaukie, unite
to organize a Woman's Medical Society, with an
examining board whose diploma shall attest the character
of the member? Dr. Storer's admirable pamphlet
entitled "Why not?" points out an evil, which
will never be remedied by thrusting empirical women
into the positions now held by unscrupulous men.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>And what have we to say of our own country?
Has the American standard reached a safe altitude,
or must we admit that it has the same limitations?
A popular width of view we have certainly gained
in the last half-century; but have we made secure
progress in the right direction? Some eighty years
ago, John Adams wrote of his wife, "This lady was
more beautiful than Lady Russell, had a brighter
genius, more information, and more refined taste, and
was at least her equal in virtues of the heart, in
fortitude and firmness of character, in resignation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the will of Heaven, and in all the virtues and
graces of the Christian life. Like Lady Russell, she
never discouraged her husband from running all hazards
for the salvation of his country's liberties; she
was willing to share with me, and that her children
should share with us both, in all the dangerous consequences
we had to hazard."</p>

<p>Will America ever offer to the world a nobler picture?
Is it at this moment above or below our average
ideal? "With such a mother," said John Quincy
Adams, in Boston, less than twenty years ago, "with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
such a mother, it has been the perpetual instruction of
my life to love and reverence the female sex; but I have
been taught also&mdash;and the lesson is still more deeply
impressed&mdash;I have been taught <em>not</em> to flatter them."
Noble words! Gentlemen to whom it falls to deliver
annually Normal-school addresses would do well
to take a lesson from them. They would wince a
little, could they hear the criticisms of the indignant
girls upon their actual advice and praise. How would
these men have liked it, if at fifteen they had been
addressed as fathers of an unborn generation, whose
especial duty it was to adapt themselves to this
sphere? And why should men complain, that women
look to marriage, and marriage only, as salvation, if
the whole tenor of their own influence is used to emphasize
it as woman's "manifest destiny"? "Are
there not <em>two</em> married, and where is the one?" What
propriety is there in assuming, in advance, that the
sphere which married life opens has a stronger hold
on one sex than the other?</p>

<p>We have said enough to show, that in Germany,
France, England, and America, the ideal standard of
education was sufficiently high over a century ago.
Why has not such actual progress been made as
might have been expected?</p>

<p>Because <em>public opinion</em> has constantly thwarted
the ideal growth. Educated women have, for the
most part, wanted courage to do what is right, unless
sustained by men. In education, for the duties
of which they are acknowledged to be superior,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
they have never insisted on the changes they knew
to be necessary, but have uniformly succumbed to
the masculine idea. Shall we blame them? Is a
conflict in the heart of a family a pleasant thing?
Certainly, the hand which the magnanimous sympathy
of men has set free cannot cast the first stone. The
slowness and faithlessness of men too often paralyzes
the best efforts of women. The faith which Isabella
showed Columbus, would be, at this moment, a grateful
return from them. Charles Lamb has shown us
how valueless to the working woman the support of
delicate sentiment may be. The ringing of the glasses
round a table dulled his exquisite ear to the fine
spheral harmonies it had once caught. He broke, in
an after-dinner tilt, the very lance with which he had
pierced to the heart of the enemy's shield. If the
ideal standard makes no headway against public
opinion, what encouragement to our hopes does common
life offer?</p>

<p>As exquisite beauty of water, hill, and dale lies hidden
in many a country hamlet, unheeded by the guidebook,
unsuspected by the traveller on the turnpike
road; so, in society, self-sacrifice, noble daring, and
saintly perseverance, nestle behind the prominent failure.
We find them everywhere, except where we
should most naturally look for them.</p>

<p>There is in England a Society for the Promotion of
Female Education in the East. It undertakes to do
<em>abroad</em> precisely the work that its individual members
refuse to assist the community to do at home. Consequently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
their printed schemes read like satires on
their individual convictions. In the year 1835, Miss
Alice Holliday called the attention of this society to
the condition of women in Egypt and Abyssinia. She
asked their sanction to her attempt to educate the
women of Egypt, with an ultimate view to those of
Abyssinia, whose condition chiefly interested her. She
had pursued a severe course of study, unfriended and
alone, before she asked this help. She had studied
the severe sciences, the antiquities and customs of the
countries themselves, and the Arabic and Coptic languages.
She was fortunate also in stirring the enthusiasm
of a certain Miss Rogers, who, unable to teach,
was yet willing to accompany her friend, and devote
her fortune to their mutual support. As these ladies
wanted no money from the society they consulted, they
were received as agents without difficulty, and reached
Alexandria in the autumn of 1836. At this time
Miss Holliday wrote: "The condition of the Coptic
women is truly lamentable. Their abodes are like the
filthiest holes in London; yet their persons are decked
out in the most costly apparel. I have seen ladies
sitting at their latticed windows, their heads and necks
adorned with pearls and diamonds of the highest
value, their bodies covered with the richest silks and
velvets, while the room they occupied was the most
disgusting scene you can imagine. Smoking and
sleeping occupy their time. Female schools have
never had an existence, and the prejudice against
them is very strong."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>We can recall the argument used in those Eastern
lands, and the answer which civilization offered. "I
am afraid to teach my women," said the Turk: "they
are already crafty and impure. To gather them into
public places is to offer a premium on immodesty,
and a temptation to misconduct." The Christian
answered proudly, "We can trust our women; yes,
even in Paris and London."</p>

<p>Soon after their arrival, Miss Rogers died; but her
friend was not discouraged. In the following March,
an officer of state, Hekekyan Effendi, came to inquire
whether she would take charge of the royal women,
one hundred in number, and the nearest relatives of the
sovereign. Much depended, it was thought, upon the
co-operation of the oldest daughter, Nas-lee Hanoom;
and it was His Highness's desire that the heads of the
family should be formed into a committee to extend
female schools. See how this Mohammedan officer
writes to Miss Holliday.</p>

<p>"You have no doubt read much about hareems," he
says, "yet little, I fear, that resembles the truth. We
pay great respect to women and aged persons, whatever
may be our own rank. Our children, however,
are uneducated, in the European sense of the term.
Besides being illiterate, they know nothing of domestic
economy; and, in the middling and lower
classes of the community, this ignorance is so profound
as to endanger, by its dire consequences, domestic
health, peace, and prosperity. This want is
the first cause of slavery and its concomitant vices.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
In seconding the illustrious efforts of Mehemet Ali, I
have been able to trace our debasement as a nation to
<em>no other cause</em> than the want of a useful and efficient
moral education for our women. In giving to them
enlightened education, we shall be striking at the root
of the evils that afflict us; we shall diminish the dangers
and misfortunes which proceed from ignorance
and idleness. Habits of industry, cleanliness, order,
and economy, by increasing happiness, make us morally
better, and will secure that moral training to our
children which no subsequent effort is sufficient to
replace."</p>

<p>So true is it that the value of words is comparative,
that all this might have been written by some
Secretary of the Board of Education in Massachusetts.
The arguments of the Turk and Effendi are
very familiar to us. Modern civilized society shuts
women out of schools to protect their modesty.
Modern professors tell us how much they respect women,
and value material training, at the very moment
when they bar the gates of life against her. On the
27th of March, 1838, Miss Holliday went in state
to the hareem. She was preceded by the two janissaries
attached to the English Consulate, bearing their
silver wands of office, and accompanied by the wife
of Hekekyan. In the ante-room they were regaled
with coffee out of golden cups set with diamonds.
Young Georgian girls of great beauty brought sherbet
and massive pipes with amber mouth-pieces. They
were then introduced to the Princess Nas-lee, a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
woman about forty, simply dressed; and, before the
interview ended, Alice had promised to spend four
hours of every day in the hareem. She began with
instruction that tended to civilize daily life; and boxes
of embroidery and baby-clothes, made for patterns in
England, excited the first lively interest. She declined
all invitations to take up her abode in the hareem,
although promised entire liberty. She was <em>humble</em>,
and, as a consequence, <em>wise</em>. She did not expect great
results, or look for much enthusiasm, in the hareem.</p>

<p>In August, she writes: "My visits have been attended
with the most cheering success. I am received and
honored with every possible distinction; but, added to
my school, it is a great fatigue." Her character in
every way sustained the effect of her teaching. She
was offered thirty pounds a month for her attendance
at the hareem, but thought ten pounds sufficient, and
would accept no more. In October, a box of presents
was received from England. When Hekekyan was
invited to look into this box, he seized upon some
scientific plates sent to the young princess. "Ah!"
said he, "these are the things we need." The Pacha
was captivated, in his turn, by an orrery, and a model
of the Thames Tunnel. The hareem sent back a similar
box, and Nas-lee herself worked a scarf for the
queen. Miss Holliday was soon ordered to translate
some of her books into Turkish; and her princesses
wrote touching letters to their English friends. Soon
after, we find this indefatigable woman teaching English,
French, drawing, and writing, in the hareem of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
late Governor of Cairo. Education must begin with
languages; for Egypt has no literature to offer to her
children. In 1840 Victoria sent to the hareem a portrait
of herself, which was carried in procession and
hung with proper honors by the side of that of the
pacha. Very soon came an Egyptian Society for the
Promotion of Female Education. Scientific instruments
and books were ordered. An infant school began
with one hundred and fifty children. The hareem
demanded another teacher, and Mrs. Lieder was sent
out. In 1844 a male school was formed, and European
teachers imported. The young girls, who had
begun with needle-work eight years before, were now
studying Turkish, Persian, and Arabic, geography,
arithmetic, and drawing. "What a change," writes
Alice in 1846,&mdash;"what a change within the last ten
years! When I came to Egypt, there was not a woman
who could read; and now some hundreds have
not only the power, but the best books. Year after
year, I have been permitted to see the growth of a
new civilization. What a change has come over the
royal family since I first entered it! The desire for
trifles is preparing the way for our noblest gifts; and
a fatal blow has been struck at the whole system
of hareems." It would be pleasant to trace this devoted
woman farther, to know whether she still lives,
and if she has reached the Abyssinian plains. In this
humble way began the great educational movement
in Egypt, which gave strength and vitality to Mehemet
Ali's best-considered plans, which has sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
scores of young princes to Paris, and will eventually
change the face of the whole land.</p>

<p>Alice Holliday succeeded, because the "sinews of
war"&mdash;namely, the "purse-strings"&mdash;were in her own
hands. Very similar in spirit was the enterprise of
Madame Luce in Algiers, of which Madame Bodichon
has given an interesting account. Madame Luce went
to Algiers, soon after the conquest, about 1834, and
was probably a teacher in the family of one of the
resident functionaries. In 1845, nearly nine years after
Alice had begun her Egyptian labors, Madame Luce
was a widow, with very little money to devote to
the work on which she had set her heart; namely, a
school to civilize the women of Algiers. Government
was already beginning to instruct the men; but the
Mohammedan dread of proselytism stood in their
way. The women were in the worst state,&mdash;closely
veiled, taught no manual arts, having no skill in
housekeeping even,&mdash;for the simple life of a warm
climate, the scanty furniture, give no scope for such
skill. To wash their linen, to clamber over the roofs
to make calls, to offer coffee and receive it, to dress
very splendidly at times, very untidily always, was
the synopsis of their lives. They did not know their
own ages, yet were liable to be sold in marriage at
the age of ten. Upon such material, and at such a
time,&mdash;when the value of a Moorish woman was estimated,
like that of a cow, <em>by her weight</em>,&mdash;Madame
Luce undertook to work. She had a Christian courage
in her heart, which might put many a man to
shame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>While laying her plans, she had perfected herself
in the native tongue, and now commenced a campaign
among the families of her acquaintance, coaxing them
to trust their little girls to her for three or four hours
a day, that they might be taught to read and write
French, and also to sew neatly. Her presents, her
philanthropic tact, her solemn promise not to interfere
in matters of religion, won for her, at length, four little
girls, whom she took to her own hired house without a
moment's delay. As the rumor of her success spread,
one child after another dropped in, till she had more
than thirty. Finding the experiment answer beyond
her hopes, she was compelled to demand assistance of
the local government. Men have no faith in quixotic
undertakings. As might have been expected, they
complimented Madame Luce upon her energy, saw
no use in educating Moorish women, and declined to
assist her. She waited, in breathless suspense, till the
day on which the Council were to meet, bribing the
parents, clothing the children, and pursuing her noble
work. "Surely," she thought, "they <em>will</em> devise some
plan;" but the twilight of the 30th of December
closed in, and they had not even alluded to her school.
On the 1st of January, 1846, it was closed. Nine
hundred miles from Paris, without the modern conveniences
of transport, what do you suppose this
woman did? Could she give up? She scorned an offer
of personal remuneration made by a few gentlemen,
and told them that what she wanted was adequate
support for a national work. She pawned her plate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
her jewels, even a gold thimble, and set off for Paris,
where she arrived early in February, and sent in her
report to the Minister of War. She went in person
from deputy to deputy, detailing her plans. Poor
Madame Luce! her success was not quite so speedy
as Alice Holliday's, whose schools had doubtless
stimulated her efforts. Everywhere she had to combat
the scepticism, the indifference, the inertia, of
worldly men. There was no Miss Rogers, with a
kind heart and a long purse, to help her on her way.
Nor did Madame Luce desire that there should be.
She knew that individual efforts of such a kind can
never last long; and she was determined to make the
government adopt and become responsible for her
work. Then it would outlive her. Then it might
redeem the nation. At last, daylight began to dawn.
The government gave her three thousand francs for
her journey, and eleven hundred more on account of
some claim of her deceased husband. They urged
her return to Algiers, and promised still farther support.
So perseveringly had she wrought, that, early
in June, she was able to re-open her school, amid the
rejoicings of parents and children. It was seven
months before the government contrived to put the
school on a better foundation. During this time, her
pupils constantly increased, and she was put to the
greatest straits to keep it together. The Curé of
Algiers gave her a little money and a great deal of
sympathy. The Count Guyot, high in office, helped
her from his own purse. When she was entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
destitute, she would send one of her negresses to
him, and he would send her enough for the day.
On one occasion, he sent a small bag of money, left
by the Duc de Nemours for the benefit of a journal
which had ceased to exist. She found in this two
hundred francs, which she received as a direct gift
from Heaven. Thus she got along from hand to
mouth. She engaged an Arab mistress, who was
remarkably cultivated, to assist her, and to train the
children in her own faith. Pledged as she was not to
instruct them in Christianity, she had the sense to see,
what few would have admitted, that such instruction
was not only necessary, but desirable. It gave them
the knowledge of one God, and made clear distinctions
between right and wrong. At last, in January, 1847,
the school was formally adopted, and received its first
visit of inspection. The gentlemen were received by
thirty-two pupils, and the Arab mistress <em>unveiled</em>; a
great triumph of common sense, if we consider how
short a time the school had been opened. Since that
time, the work has steadily prospered. In 1858 it
numbered one hundred and twenty pupils, between
the ages of four and eighteen. The practical wisdom
of Madame Luce led her to establish a workshop,
where the older pupils learned the value of their labor,
and earned a good deal of money. They had always
a week's work in advance, when the wise, slow
government put an end to it, whether to save the
thirty-five pounds a year, which the salary of its
superintendent cost, or to prevent competition with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the nunneries, Madame Luce has never known. <em>She</em>
thought it the best part of her plan,&mdash;far better than
teaching the girls to turn a French phrase neatly
for the satisfaction of inspectors. The government
are now beginning to understand her value.
They have established a second school in Algiers,
and several in the provinces. The results are not
miraculous, but they plant new germs of moral power
and thought in every family circle which they touch.
Such names as those of Alice Holliday and Madame
Luce have a great value. These women and their
labors are permeated by the Christian idea of self-surrender.
The preponderance of this idea in these
examples distinguishes them above women of the
past, whether German <em>exaltadas</em>, brilliant adventurers
amid the perils of the Froude, or witty loiterers in the
<em>salon</em> of Madame de Sablé.</p>

<p>La Rochefoucauld, who was proud of Mademoiselle
and her princesses, would only have sneered at
Madame Luce; nor would Lady Russell, nor Mrs.
John Adams, have followed Alice to Egypt cheerfully.
Nor do these two women belong to the army of saints
and martyrs. A religious devotee has in her a mistaken
enthusiasm, and goes <em>away from</em> the world.
These women are doing the work of saints and martyrs
with a far higher appreciation of God's providence,
of the uses of this world, and with all the
hindrances that fall to the lot of simple human beings.
It is not our intention to multiply such instances here:
they belong, rather, to the illustrations of individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
power. We must not forget, however, the existence,
in England, of that circle of women, of whom Mrs.
Bodichon, Mrs. Hugo Reid, Mrs. Browning, Mrs.
Fox, Mrs. Jameson, and Bessie Raynor Parkes, are
honorable examples. We have such lives as those of
Mrs. Gaskell and Miss Evans; the scientific reputation
not alone of Mrs. Somerville, but of Mrs. Griffith,
to whose masculine power of research English
marine botany may be said to owe its existence, and
who still survives, at an advanced age, to see that
knowledge becomes popular, in her cheerful and honored
decline, which she pursued, for many a year,
unassisted and alone. We have Mrs. Janet Taylor,
one of the best and most popular teachers of navigation
and nautical mathematics in all England. Her
classes have been celebrated and numerously attended
by men who have been long at sea, as well as by
youths preparing for the merchant service; and, still
farther, we have in cultivated circles, to balance the
old prejudice, an encouraging liberality. A review,
published in the Westminster, after the issue of Miss
Martineau's pamphlet on the future government of
India, shows conclusively that any woman who will
do <em>good</em> work may feel sure of honest appreciation.
If she does poor work, she will only the more provoke
the enemy. Nothing could have been more ambitious
than Miss Martineau's theme; but, when she showed
herself well qualified to handle it, no one had any
disposition to consider the choice unwomanly. Such
criticisms are the exponents of the century's experience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
They betray the unconscious drift of the
public mind. A book is modest by the side of a
pamphlet. The former may wait its day: the latter
aspires to immediate influence, if it does any thing,&mdash;must
mould the hour. It was once the chosen
weapon of Milton and Bolingbroke, later of Ward and
Brougham. Is it nothing, that a woman of advanced
years, writing from an invalid's chamber, feels herself
competent to wield it? Was it nothing, when, by
her tracts on political economy, she gave an impulse
to the middle classes of her native land, for which
busy political men could not find time?</p>

<p>Is it not Godwin who says that "human nature is
better read in romance than history"? Every actual
life falls short of its ideal; but a poem dares demand
some approximation to its standard from the whole
world. In this way, "Aurora Leigh," into which Mrs.
Browning confesses she has thrown her whole heart,
is a wonderful indication of human thought and feeling.
In this country, there are many significant signs
of progress. The name of Maria Mitchell in astronomy;
of the women engaged in the Coast Survey; of
the professors at Antioch, Vassar, and Oberlin,&mdash;are
familiarly known, and have their own power. Only
lately, a Nashua factory-girl takes the highest honors
at the Oread Institute; and its principal is willing to
put her and two other graduates into competition
with any three college graduates in New England for
examination according to the curriculum. When she
finished the education she had first earned the money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
to procure, she left her Worcester home, and, with
quiet right-mindedness, went back to Nashua to labor
for an indigent family. As she tends her loom on the
Jackson Corporation, she will have leisure to investigate
her <em>right</em> to these acquisitions.</p>

<p>In support of this "exception," the superintendent
of the New-York City Schools, long ago, reported, that
its female schools, whether by merit of teachers or
pupils or both, are of a much higher grade than the
male schools. Eighteen girls'-schools are superior, in
average attainment, to the very best boys'-school.
He goes on to speak of the rapidity with which
women acquire knowledge, in terms which remind us
of Margaret Fuller, when she remarks of Dr. Channing,
that it was not very pleasant to read to him;
"for," said she, "he takes in subjects more deliberately
than is conceivable to us feminine people, with our
habits of ducking, diving, or flying for truth." In
speaking of her classes at Vassar College, Miss
Mitchell says (1865): "I have a class of seventeen
pupils, between the ages of sixteen and twenty-two.
They come to me for fifty minutes every day. I
allow them great freedom in questioning, and I am
puzzled by them daily. They show more mathematical
ability, and more originality of thought, than I had
expected. I doubt whether young men would show
as deep an interest. Are there seventeen students in
Harvard College who take mathematical astronomy,
do you think?"</p>

<p>At the session of the Michigan Legislature, held in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
1857-8, petitions were received, asking that women
might be permitted to enjoy all the advantages of the
State University. The committee to whom the subject
was referred, took counsel with the older colleges
at the East, whose whole spirit and method is as
much opposed to such an idea as that of Oxford.
The result was, that they reported against any change
for the present,&mdash;a report the more to be regretted, as
Ann Arbor has a broader University foundation than
any institution within the limits of the United States.
The University has lately petitioned for a larger endowment,
and again an effort has been made to secure
its advantages for women; Theodore Tilton pleading
before the committee in their behalf, in February,
1867. We know of twenty-seven colleges in the
United States, open to men and women, of which
Oberlin was the noble pioneer.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The highest culture has been claimed for women:
it has been shown, that, for two centuries, the ideal of
such a culture has existed, but has been depressed by
an erroneous public opinion. There has, however,
been a steady growth in the right direction, which entitles
us to ask for a "revised and corrected" public
opinion. The influence of mental culture is a small
thing by the side of that insinuating atmospheric
power and the customs of society which it controls.
All educated men and women, all liberal souls, therefore,
should do their utmost to invigorate public opinion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
To allow no weakness to escape us, to challenge
every falsehood as it passes, to brave every insinuation
and sneer, is what duty demands. Can you not bear
to be called "women's-rights women"? To whom has
the name ever been agreeable? Society gives the lie
to your purest instincts, and you bear it. It calls the
truths you accept hard names, and you are dumb. It
throws stones, and you shrink behind some ragged
social fence, leaving a few weak women to stand the
assault alone.</p>

<p>What influence has the highest literary character
of America, at this moment, on the popular idea of
women? "How much is there that we may not say
<em>aloud</em>," wrote Niebuhr to Savigny, "for fear of being
stoned by the stupid <em>good</em> people!" and upon this
principle the thinkers of our society act; not a word
escaping from their guarded homes to cheer the more
exposed workers.</p>

<p>Prescott stabbed Philip II. to the heart without
a qualm. Ticknor could give a life to the romance
of old Spain. Froude has defended Henry VIII.
Our best poets sing verses that enslave, since the song
of beauty echoes always among tropical delights.
"Barbara Frietchie" alone has been written for us.
When George Curtis blows his clarion, a courtly
throng come at the call. We yield with the rest to
the charm of the lips on which Attic bees once clustered.
What honor do we pay the fair proportions
of the simple truth?</p>

<p>How can we settle questions of right and wrong for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
remote periods, without knowing the faces of either in
the street to-day? How shall any one honor Margaret
of Parma, and pity poor crazy Joan in Spain, and
have no heart for the heroism of Mary Patton? How
unravel with patient study the <em>tracasseries</em> of Elizabeth
Tudor and Mary Stuart, yet ignore the complications
of the life he himself lives?</p>

<p>When Mary Patton had carried her ship round
Cape Horn,&mdash;standing in a parlor where the air was
close, though the breezes that entered at its open
casement swept the Common as they came, a woman
told, with newly kindled enthusiasm, the story of that
wonderful voyage. She gave her, in warm words,
her wifely and womanly due. "She saved the ship,
God bless her!" she said as she concluded; and another
voice, that once was sweet, responded, "More
shame to her!"</p>

<p>"'More shame to her!'" repeated the first speaker,
as if she had been struck a sudden blow; and turning
quickly towards the girl, beautiful, well educated,
carefully reared, who, in the fulness of her twenty
summers, found time for church-going, for clothing
the poor, for elegant study, for every thing but sympathy,&mdash;"More
shame!" she repeated: "What! for
saving life and property?"&mdash;"Better that they should
all have gone to the bottom," returned her friend,
"than that one woman should step out of her
sphere!" Ah! the Infinite Father knows how to
educate the public opinion that we need. Now and
then he lifts a woman, as he did Mary Patton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
against her will out of her ordinary routine; and,
while all the world gaze at her with tender sympathy,
they half accept the coming future.</p>

<p>Does it sadden you, that we should repeat such
words? They did not shock the ears on which they
fell; they met no farther rebuke than one astonished
question. Yet what did they represent? Not the
public opinion of Mary Patton. The New-York underwriters,
when they voted her a thousand dollars,
were a fit gauge of that. It was the public opinion
of the "right of vocation" that the young girl unconsciously
betrayed. Harsh words die on our lips, as
we think, "This girl's life is aimless. <em>She</em> would
gladly do some noble work, but society does not help
her. She lacks courage to stand alone, and envies
the very woman she decries."</p>

<p>"Public opinion is of slow growth," you retort:
"do not charge its corruptions on the people of to-day."</p>

<p>The people of to-day are responsible for any corruptions
which they do not reject.</p>

<p>We have seen that the standard of womanly
education does not lead where it should, because
controlled by a public opinion which demands too
little. It becomes us here to investigate the origin
of that public opinion, and to ask the meaning of
the lives which have been lived in its despite.</p>

<p class="center"><strong>HOW PUBLIC OPINION IS MADE.</strong></p>

<div class="container">

</div>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">THE existing public opinion with regard to woman
has been formed by the influence of heathen ages
and institutions, kept up by a mistaken study of the
classics,&mdash;a study so pursued, that Athens and Rome,
Aristophanes and Juvenal, are more responsible for
the popular views of woman, and for the popular mistakes
in regard to man's position toward her, than
any thing that has been written later.</p>

<p>This influence pervades all history; and so the
study of history becomes, in its turn, the source of
still greater and more specious error, except to a few
rare and original minds, whose eccentricities have
been pardoned to their genius, but who have never
influenced the world to the extent that they have
been influenced by it.</p>

<p>The adages or proverbs of all nations are the outgrowths
of their first attempts at civilization. They
began at a time which knew neither letter-paper nor
the printing-press; and they perpetuate the rudest
ideas, such as are every way degrading to womanly
virtue. The influence of general literature is impelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
by the mingled current. For many centuries, it was
the outgrowth of male minds only, of such as had
been drilled for seven years at least into all the heathenisms
of which we speak.</p>

<p>Women, when they first began to work, followed
the masculine idea, shared the masculine culture. As
a portion of general literature, the novel, as the most
popular, exerts the widest sway. No educational influence
in this country compares with it; even that of
the pulpit looks trivial beside it. There are thousands
whom that influence never reaches; hardly one who
cannot beg or buy a newspaper, with its story by some
"Sylvanus Cobb."</p>

<p>From the first splash of the Atlantic on a Massachusetts
beach to the farthest cañon which the
weary footsteps of the Mormon women at this moment
press; from the shell-bound coast of Florida,
hung with garlands of orange and lime, to the cold,
green waters of Lake Superior, in their fretted chalice
of copper and gold,&mdash;the novel holds its way. On
the railroad, at the depot, in the Irish hut, in the Indian
lodge, on the steamer and the canal-boat, in the Fifth-avenue
palace, and the Five-Points den of infamy, its
shabby livery betrays the work that it is doing.</p>

<p>Until very lately, it has kept faith with history and
the classics; but it is passing more and more into the
hands of women,&mdash;of late into the hands of noble
and independent women; and there are signs which
indicate that it may soon become a potent influence
of redemption. It has thus far done infinite harm, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
drawing false distinctions between the masculine and
feminine elements of human nature, and perpetuating,
through the influence of genius often <em>intensifying</em>, the
educational power of a false theory of love.</p>

<p>Social customs follow in the train of literature; and
sometimes in keeping with popular errors, but oftener
in stern opposition to them, are the lives and labors
of remarkable individuals of both sexes,&mdash;lives that
show, if they show nothing else, how much the resolute
endeavor of one noble heart may do towards
making real and popular its own convictions.</p>

<p>The influence of newspapers sustains, of course,
the general current derived from all these sources.</p>

<p>Public opinion, then, flows out of these streams,&mdash;out
of classical literature, history, general reading,
and the proverbial wisdom of all lands; out of social
conventions, and customs and newspapers. These
streams set one way. Only individual influences remain,
to stem their united force.</p>

<p>We must treat of them more at length, and first of
the classics. Until very lately, there were no proper
helps to the study of Egyptian, Greek, or Roman
mythology. It was studied by the letter, and made
to have more or less meaning, according to the teacher
who interpreted it. Lemprière had no room for moral
deductions or symbolic indications; his columns read
like a criminal report in the "New-York Herald."
The Egyptian mythology was, doubtless, an older off-shoot
from the same stem. Many of its ceremonies,
its symbols, and its idols, must be confused by the uninstructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
mind with realities of the very lowest, perhaps
we should not be far wrong if we said, of the
most revolting stamp. The Greek classics, so far as
I know them, present a singular mixture of influences;
but, where woman is concerned, the lowest
certainly preponderate. We should be sorry to lose
Homer and Æschylus, Herodotus, Thucydides, and
Xenophon, from our library; but of how many poets
and dramatists, from the few fragments of Pindar and
Anacreon down through the tragic poets,&mdash;down,
very far down, indeed, to Aristophanes,&mdash;can we say
as much?</p>

<p>There need be no doubt about Aristophanes. The
world would be the purer, and all women grateful, if
every copy of his works, and every coarse inference
from them, could be swept out of existence to-morrow.
When we find a <em>noble picture</em> in Xenophon, it had a
noble original, like Panthea in Persia, as old perhaps
as that fine saying in the Heetopades which all the
younger Veds disown. When we find an <em>ignoble
thought</em>, it seems to have been born out of his Greek
experience. Transported by a fair ideal, Plato asks,
in his "Republic," "Should not this sex, which we condemn
to obscure duties, be destined to functions the
most noble and elevated?" But it was only to take
back the words in his "Timæus," and in the midst of
a society that refused to let the wife sit at table with the
husband, and whose young wives were not "tame"
enough to speak to their husbands, if we may believe
the words of Xenophon, until after months of marriage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
When Iscomachus, the model of an Athenian
husband, and the friend of Socrates, asked his wife if
she knew whether he had married her for love, "I
know nothing," she replied, "but to be faithful to you,
and to learn what you teach." He responded by an
exhortation on "<em>staying at home</em>," which has come
down to posterity, and left her, with a kiss, for the
saloon of Aspasia! Pindar and Anacreon, even when
they find no better representatives than Dr. Wolcott
and Tom Moore, still continue to crown the wine-cup,
and impart a certain grace to unmanly orgies. A
late French writer goes so far as to call Euripides
"a woman-hater, who could not pardon Zeus for
having made woman an indispensable agent in the
preservation of the species." In his portraits of
Iphigenia and Macaria, Euripides follows his conception
of <em>heroic</em>, not human nature. They are demi-goddesses;
yet how are their white robes stained!</p>

<p>Here is the popular idea which curses society to-day,&mdash;no
vocation possible to woman, if she may not be a
wife, and bear children: and these are favorable specimens;
they show the practical tendencies of the very
best of Euripides. The heroic portions are like Miriam's
song, and have nothing to do with us and our
experiences.</p>

<p>In speaking of Aristophanes, I do not speak ignorantly.
I know how much students consider themselves
indebted to him for details of manners and
customs, for political and social hints, for a sort of
Dutch school of pen-painting.</p>

<p>But if a nation's life be so very vile, if crimes that
we cannot name and do not understand be among
its amusements, why permit the record to taint the
mind and inflame the imagination of youth? Why
put it with our own hands into the desks of those
in no way prepared to use it? Would you have wit
and humor? Sit down with Douglas Jerrold, or to
the genial table spread by our Boston Autocrat, and
you will have no relish left for the coarse fare of the
Athenian. One of the most vulgar assaults ever
made upon the movement to elevate woman in this
country was made in a respectable quarterly by a
Greek scholar. It was sustained by quotations from
Aristophanes, and concluded by copious translations
from one of his liveliest plays, offered as a specimen
of the "riot and misrule" that we ambitious women
were ready to inaugurate. Coarser words still our
Greek scholar might have taken from the same source<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to illustrate his theory. He knew very well that the
nineteenth century would bear hints, insinuations,
sneers, any thing but plain speaking. We have
limits: he observed them, and forbore. Women sometimes
talk of Aristophanes as if they had read his
plays with pleasure; a thing for which we can only
account by supposing that they do not take the whole
significance of what they read,&mdash;and this is often the
case with men. But a college furnishes helps. The
mysteries of the well-thumbed English key are translated
afresh into what we may call "college slang,"
illustrated oftentimes by clever if vulgar caricatures,
where a few significant lines tell in a moment what
a pure mind would have pondered years without
perceiving; and if, perchance, some modest woman
finds her friend or lover at this work, society says
only: "You should not have touched the young
man's book. What harm for him to amuse himself?&mdash;only
women should never find it out! Keep them
pure, no matter what becomes of men. What business
had you to know the meaning of those pencil
marks?"</p>

<p>Even St. John does not hesitate to condemn Aristophanes.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
"With an art in which Shakespeare was
no mean proficient," he begins, "he opens up a more
culpable source of interest in the frequent satire of
vices condemned as commonly as they are practised.
He unveils the mysteries of iniquity with a fearless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and by no means an unreluctant hand. He ventures
fearlessly on themes which few before or since have
touched, despising the stern condemnation of posterity.
He evidently shared in the worst corruptions
of his age, and, like many other satirists, availed himself
joyfully of the mask of satire to entertain his
own imagination with his own descriptions. No one,
with the least clear-sightedness or candor, can fail
to perceive the depraved moral character of Aristophanes.
Only less filthy than Rabelais, his fancy
runs riot among the moral jakes and common sewers
of the world, over which, by consummate art and the
matchless magic of his style, he contrives unhappily
to breathe a fragrance which should never be found
save where virtue is."</p>

<p>When I first took up my pen, knowing well that I
should speak of Margaret Fuller's beloved Greeks in
a tone somewhat different from hers, I did not know
that I should have the sympathy of a single eminent
scholar.</p>

<p>It was with no common pleasure, therefore, that,
opening her Life at random, one day, I chanced upon
these words from her own pen. She is speaking of
a class of private pupils:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have always thought all that was said about
the anti-religious tendency of a classical education
to be 'auld wives' tales.' But the puzzles (of my
pupils) about Virgil's notions of heaven and virtue,
and his gracefully described gods and goddesses,
have led me to alter my opinions; and I suspect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
from reminiscences of my own mental history, that,
if all teachers do not think the same, it is from
the want of an intimate knowledge of their pupils'
minds. I really find it difficult to keep their <em>morale</em>
steady, and am inclined to think many of my own
sceptical sufferings are traceable to this source. I
well remember what reflections arose in my childish
mind from a comparison of the Hebrew history,
where every moral obliquity is shown out with such
<i xml:lang="fr">naïveté</i>, and the Greek history, full of sparkling deeds
and brilliant sayings, and their gods and goddesses,
the types of beauty and power, with the dazzling veil
of flowery language and poetical imagery cast over
their vices and failings."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>We may be permitted also to quote, from the competent
pen of Buckle, the following words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have only to open the Greek literature," he
says, in his lecture on "The Condition of Women,"
"to see with what airs of superiority, with what serene
and lofty contempt, with what mocking and
biting scorn, women were treated by that lively and
ingenious people, who looked upon them <em>merely as
toys</em>."</p>

<p>Alas! we need no prophet to show that what pollutes
the mind of youth and lover, by polluting the
ideal of society, must soon pollute the mind of
maiden and mistress. Is that a Christian country
which permits this style of thinking? and how many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
men of the world accept the stainless virginity of
Christ as the world's pattern of highest manliness?</p>

<p>Passing from Greece to Rome, you will see that
even as we owe to Roman law, before the time of
Justinian, almost all that is obnoxious in the English,
retaining still the strange old Latin terms which were
applied to our relations in a very barbarous state of
society; so we owe to the time of Augustus, to the
influence of satirists like Horace and Juvenal, almost
all the wide-spread heresies in regard to human nature:
if we had but time to look at it, we might say
Calvinism among the rest.</p>

<p>The views of women are still lower. Cæsar and
Cicero may be abstract nullities to our young student;
but what can he learn from Ovid? It is not delicate
to name the "Art of Love." In simple, honest truth,
it is the same to read the Metamorphoses. You
cannot ventilate a gross man's atmosphere; all the
Betsy Trotwoods must toss their cushions on the lawn
when he leaves the room. It is the old difference between
"Don Juan" and "Childe Harold," only less. In
the first, the unvarnished play of passion may disgust
you until it instructs; in the second, you have the
despairing misanthropy, the false philosophy, the
devil in Gabriel's own garment, which is always
fascinating to the young, morbid with the stimulus
of growth, and which you might mistake for piety if
you did not know it was born of the lassitude left by
excess.</p>

<p>Latin mythology was but the corruption of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
older types. What was beauty once became here
undisguised coarseness or worse. The gods who
once endured sin now patronized and made money
by it. These things are not without their influence.
Above all, low images, witty slang, and sharp satire,
have force beyond their own, when slowly studied out
by the help of the lexicon. The women to whom I
speak know this very well. They know that the Molière,
the Dante, the Schiller, studied at school, are
never forgotten. They smile to hear men call them
hard to read: for them they glow with clear and significant
meaning. Striking passages are indelibly
impressed by associations of time or place or page,
which can never be forgotten. <em>I would not put an
end to classical study; I would only direct attention,
through such remarks, to the dangers attendant on the
present manner of study. Classical teachers should not
be chosen for their learning alone. No Lord Chesterfield
should teach manners, but some one whose daily
"good morning" is precious. So no coarse, low-minded
man should interpret Greek or Roman, but some noble
soul, not indifferent to social progress, capable of discriminating,
and of letting in a little Christian light
upon those pagan times.</em> Where men and women are
taught together, this thing settles itself; and this is a
very strong argument for institutions like Antioch
and Oberlin.</p>

<p>Then might the period passed at the Latin school
and the college become of the greatest moral and intellectual
use. Then would no graduating students<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
run the risk of hearing from their favorite doctor of
divinity, instead of sound scriptural exhortation, some
doctrine whisked out of Epicurus, by a clever but
unconscious <i xml:lang="Latn">leger-de-plume</i>.</p>

<p>Do not tell us, O excellent man! that you have
gone through all this training, and come out with
your soul unstained. We look at you, and see a
temperament cold as ice, passions and imagination
that were never at a blood-heat since you were born,
that never translated the cold paper image into the
warm deed of your conscious mental life; and you
shall not answer for us, nor for our children.</p>

<p>In leaving this branch of our subject to be more
fitly pursued by others, we ought to add that mental
purity is not enough insisted upon for either
sex. It is only by the greatest faithfulness from the
beginning in this respect that we become capable of
"touching pitch" at a mature age, in a way to benefit
either ourselves or the community. How desirable it
is to keep the young eye steadily gazing at the light
till it feels all that is lost in darkness, to keep the
atmosphere serene and holy till the necessary conflicts
of life begin! For such a dayspring to existence no
price could be too high; and, if <em>desirable</em> to all, it is
<em>essential</em> to those who inherit degrading tendencies.</p>

<p>We must speak now of history. For the most
part, it has been written by men devoid of intentional
injustice to the sex; but, when a man sits in a certain
light, he is penetrated by its color, as the false shades
in our omnibuses strike the fairest bloom black and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
blue. If the positive knowledge and Christian candor
of the nineteenth century cannot compel Macaulay to
confess that he has libelled the name of William
Penn, what may be expected of the mistakes occasioned
by the ignorance, the inadvertence, or the false
theories of the past? Clearly that they also will remain
uncorrected.</p>

<p>If men start with the idea that woman is an inferior
being, incapable of wide interests, and created for
their pleasure alone; if they enact laws and establish
customs to sustain these views; if, for the most part,
they shut her into hareems, consider her so dangerous
that she may not walk the streets without a veil,&mdash;they
will write history in accordance with such views,
and, whatever may be the facts, they will be interpreted
to suit them. They will dwell upon the lives which
their theories explain: they will touch lightly or ignore
those that puzzle them. We shall hear a great deal
of Cleopatra and Messalina, of the mother of Nero
and of Lucretia Borgia, of Catharine de Medicis and
Marie Stuart, of the beautiful Gabrielle and Ninon
de L'Enclos. They will tell us of bloody Mary, and
that royal coquette, Elizabeth; and possibly of some
saints and martyrs, not too grand in stature to wear
the strait-jacket of their theories.</p>

<p>If they think that purity is required of woman
alone, and all license permitted to man, they will value
female chastity for the service it does poetry and the
state, but never maidenhood devoted to noble uses
and conscious of an immortal destiny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Hypatia of Alexandria, noble and queenly, so
queenly that those who did not understand, dared not
libel her,&mdash;Hypatia, a woman of intellect so keen and
grasping, that she would have been eminent in the
nineteenth century, and may be met in the circles of
some future sphere, erect and calm, by the side of our
own Margaret Fuller,&mdash;she, who died a stainless virgin,
torn in pieces by dogs, because she tried to shelter
some wretched Jews from Christian wrath, and could
even hold her Neo-Platonism a holier thing than that
disgraced Christianity,&mdash;what do we know of her?
Only the little which the letters of Synesius preserve,
only the testimony borne by a few Christians, fathers
of the Church <em>now</em>, but outlawed <em>then</em> by the popular
grossness! Yet, a pure and fragrant waif from the
dark ocean of that past, her name was permitted to
float down to us, till Kingsley caught it, and, with
the unscrupulousness of the advocate, <em>stained</em> it to
serve his purpose.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>It would have been no matter, had not genius set
its seal on the work, and so made it doubtful whether
history has any Hypatia left. We must not fail to
utter constant protest against such unfairness; and to
assert again and again, that not a single weakness or
folly attributed to Hypatia by the novelist&mdash;neither
the worship of Venus Anadyomene nor the prospective
marriage with the Roman governor, neither the superstitious
fears, the ominous self-conceit, nor the half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
conscious personal ambition&mdash;is in the least sustained
by the facts of history. She was pure and
stainless: let us see to it that such memories are
rescued.</p>

<p>And there is still another name, deeply wronged by
the prejudice and party spirit of the past, which it is
quite possible to redeem: I mean that of Aspasia.
For many centuries, the very sound of it suggested
an image of all womanly grace and genius, devoid
of womanly virtue; the insight of a seer, the eloquence
of an orator, but the voluptuousness of a
courtesan. Very lately, the manly justice of Thirlwall
and Grote, and the exquisite taste and imagination
of Walter Savage Landor, have striven to repair
the wrong. Her reputation fell a victim to the gross
puns of Aristophanes, himself the hired mouth-piece
of a political party that hated her, and whose misrepresentations
were so contemptible in the eyes of Pericles,
that he would not interfere to prevent them.</p>

<p>Would you have the history of that immortal marriage
written truly?</p>

<p>Imagine the Greek ruler married, for some years,
to a woman of the noblest Athenian blood, already
the mother of two children, but one who, if irreproachable
in conduct, was utterly incapable of taking
in the scope of his plans, or sharing his lofty,
adventurous thought. After years of weariness passed
in her society, with no rest for his heart and no inspiration
for his genius, there came to Athens a woman
and a foreigner, in whom he found his peer,&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
woman who gathered round her in a moment all that
there was of free and noble in that world of poetry,
statesmanship, and art. She was from the islands of
the Archipelago, and, like the women of her country,
walked the streets with her face unveiled.</p>

<p>Hardly had she come, before Socrates and Plato, and
Anaxagoras the pure old man, became her frequent
guests, and honored her with the name of friend. In
such a society, Pericles saw that his own soul would
grow; so sustained, he should be more for Athens
and himself. He was no Christian to deny himself
for the sake of that unhappy wife and children,&mdash;a
wife whose discontent had already infected the
state. The gods he knew&mdash;Zeus and Eros&mdash;smiled
on the step he took. What if the laws of Athens
forbade a legal marriage with a foreigner? Pericles
was Athens; and what he respected, all men must
honor. Aspasia had, so far as we know, a free maiden
heart; and Pericles shows us in what light he regarded
her, by divorcing his wife to consolidate their union,
and subsequently forcing the courts to legitimate her
child. Had he omitted these proofs of his own sincerity
and her honor, not a voice would have been
raised against either. What need to take these steps,
if she were the woman Aristophanes would have us
see?</p>

<p>This divorce created or strengthened the political
opposition to Pericles. This opposition was headed
by his two sons and their forsaken mother, joined
by the pure Athenian blood to which theirs was akin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and gained all its strength and popularity from the
wit and falsehood of Aristophanes and the players.</p>

<p>Follow the story as it goes, and see Aspasia, at
last, summoned before the Areopagus. What are the
charges against her? The very same that were preferred
against her friends, Socrates and Anaxagoras.
"She walks the streets unveiled, she sits at the table
with men, she does not believe in the Greek gods, she
talks about one sole Creator, she has original ideas
about the motions of the sun and moon; <em>therefore</em>
her society corrupts youth." Not a word about vice
of any sort. Is it for abandoned women that the
best men of any age are willing to entreat before a
senate? The tears which Pericles shed then for
Aspasia glitter like gems on the historic page.</p>

<p>When the plague came, his first thought was for
her safety; and, after his death, her name shares the
retirement of her widowed life. There was a rumor
that she afterward married a rich grazier, whom she
raised to eminence in the state. Not unlikely that
such a rumor might grow in the minds of those who
had not forgotten the great men <em>she</em> made, when they
saw the success of Lysicles; but other authors assert
that his wife was the Aspasia who was also known as
a midwife in Athens.</p>

<p>It is a noble picture, it seems to me; and when we
consider the prejudice of a Christian age and country,
the mob that a Bloomer skirt will attract in our own
cities, we need not wonder that slander followed an
unveiled face in Athens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>What do we know of the women of the age of
Augustus?&mdash;of the galaxy that spanned the sky of
Louis XIV.?</p>

<p>Do you remember, as you read of those crowds of
worthless women, what sort of public opinion educated
them,&mdash;what sort of public opinion such histories
tend to form? Do you ever ask any questions
concerning the men of the same eras,&mdash;how they
employed their time, and what part they took in those
games of wanton folly? It is time that some one
should: and I cannot help directing your attention to
the significant fact, that while the word "mistress,"
applied to a woman, serves at once to mark her out
for reprobation, there is no corresponding term, which,
applied to man, produces the same effect; and this
because the interests of the state are still paramount
to the interests of the soul itself.</p>

<p>In speaking of the court of Charles II., Dr. William
Alexander says, in 1799: "Its <em>tone</em> ruined all women:
they were either adored as angels, or degraded to
brute beasts. The satirists, who immediately arose,
despised what they had themselves created, and gave
the character to every line that has since been written
concerning women," down to the verses of Churchill,
and that often-quoted, well-remembered line of Pope,
with which we need not soil our lips.</p>

<p>We may quote here a criticism upon the "Cinq-Mars"
of Alfred de Vigny, taken from Lady Morgan's
"France." You will find it especially interesting,
because it bears on what has been suggested of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
influence of history, and may be compared with a
portion of one of Margaret Fuller's letters, in which
she criticises the same work, and makes, in her own
way, parallel reflections.</p>

<p>"I dipped also," says Lady Morgan, "into the
'Cinq-Mars' of Alfred de Vigny, a charming production.
It gives the best course of practical politics, in
its exposition of the miseries and vices incidental to
the institutions of the middle ages. Behold Richelieu
and Louis XIII. in the plenitude of their bad
passions and unquestioned power, when&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">'Torture interrogates and Pain replies.'</span><br />
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Behold, too, their victims,&mdash;Urbain, Grandier, De
Thou, Cinq-Mars, and the long, heart-rending list
of worth, genius, and innocence immolated. With
such pictures in the hands of the youth of France, it
is impossible they should retrograde. How different
from the works of Louis XV.'s days, when the Marivaux,
Crebillons, and Le Clos wrote for the especial
corruption of that society from whose profligacy they
borrowed their characters, incidents, and morals!
Men would not now dare to name, in the presence of
virtuous women, works which were once in the hands
of every female of rank in France,&mdash;works which,
like the novels of Richardson, had the seduction of
innocence for their story, and witty libertinism and
triumphant villany for their principal features.</p>

<p>"With such a literature, it was almost a miracle
that one virtuous woman or one honest man was left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
in the country to create that revolution which was to
purify its pestiferous atmosphere. Admirable for its
genius, this work is still more so for its honesty."</p>

<p>In the praise given to this new literature is implied
the censure passed upon the old. Of direct educational
literature, we may say, that all writers, from
Rousseau to Gregory, Fordyce, and the very latest
in our own country, have exercised an enervating
influence over public opinion, and helped to form
the popular estimate of female ability. Rousseau's
influence is still powerful. Let me quote from his
"Emilius:" "Researches into abstract and speculative
truths, the principles and axioms of science,&mdash;in
short, every thing which tends to generalize ideas,&mdash;is
out of the province of woman. All her ideas
should be directed to the <em>study of men</em>. As to works
of genius, they are beyond her capacity. She has not
precision enough to succeed in accurate science; and
physical knowledge belongs to those who are most
active and most <em>inquisitive</em>."</p>

<p>Alas for Mary Somerville, Janet Taylor, and
Maria Mitchell, as well as for the popular idea that
women are a <em>curious</em> sex! He goes on: "Woman
should have the skill to incline <em>us</em> to do every thing
which her sex will not enable her to do of herself.
She should learn to penetrate the real sentiments
of men, and should have the art to communicate
those which are most agreeable to them, without
<em>seeming to intend it</em>."</p>

<p>This sounds somewhat barefaced; but it is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
model of all the advice which society is still giving.
It is refreshing to catch the first gleam of something
better from the author of "Sandford and Merton."
"If women," says Mr. Day, "are in general feeble
both in body and mind, it arises less from nature
than from education. We encourage a vicious indolence
and inactivity, which we falsely call delicacy.
Instead of hardening their minds by the severer principles
of reason and philosophy, we breed them to
useless arts which terminate in vanity or sensuality.
They are taught nothing but idle postures and foolish
accomplishments." Dr. Gregory recommends dissimulation.
Dr. Fordyce advises women to increase
their power by reserve and coldness! When we hear
of the educational restraints still exercised, of the innocent
amusements forbidden, the compositions which
may be written, but not read, lest the young girl
might some time become the lecturer,&mdash;we cannot
but feel that the step is not so very long from that
time and country to this, and wonder at the folly
which still refuses to trust the laws of God to a
natural development. It is mortifying, too, to listen to
the silly rhapsodies of Madame de Staël. "Though
Rousseau has endeavored," she says, "to prevent
women from interfering in public affairs, and acting
a brilliant part in political life, yet, in speaking of
them, how much has he done it to <em>their satisfaction</em>!
If he wished to deprive them of some rights foreign
to their sex, how has he for ever asserted for them
all those to which it has a claim! What signifies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
it," she continues, "that his reason disputes with
them for empire, while his heart is still devotedly
theirs?"</p>

<p>What signifies it? It signifies a great deal. It
signifies all the difference between life in a solitary
seraglio, and life with God's world for an inheritance;
all the difference between being the worn-out toy of
one sensualist, and the inspiration of an unborn age;
all the difference between the butterfly and the seraph,
between the imprisoned nun and Longfellow's sweet
St. Philomel. When we read these words, we thank
Margaret Fuller for the very criticism which once
moved a girlish ire. "De Staël's name," she wrote,
"was not clear of offence; she could not forget the
woman in the thought. Sentimental tears often
dimmed her eagle glance." What a grateful contrast
to all such sentimentalism do we find in Margaret's
own sketch of the early life of Miranda!</p>

<p>"This child was early led to feel herself a child
of the spirit. She took her place easily in the world of
mind. A dignified sense of self-dependence was given
as all her portion, and she found it a sure anchor.
Her relations with others were fixed with equal
security. With both men and women they were
noble; affectionate without passion, intellectual without
coldness. The world was free to her, and she
lived freely in it. Outward adversity came, and
inward conflict; but that self-respect had early been
awakened, which must always lead at last to an outward
security and an inward peace." Here is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
great difficulty in the education of woman, to lead
her to a point from which she shall naturally develop
self-respect, and learn self-help. Old prejudices extinguish
her as an individual, oblige her to renounce the
inspiration in herself, and yield to all the weaknesses
and wickednesses of man. Look at Chaucer's beau-ideal
of a wife in the tale of Griselda, dwindled now
into the patient Grissel of modern story. In her a
woman is represented as perfect, because she ardently
and constantly loved a monster who gained her by
guile, and brutally abused her. Put the matter into
plain English, and see if you would respect such a
woman now. No: and therefore is it somewhat sad,
that, in Tennyson's new Idyll, he must recreate this
ideal in the Enid of Geraint; and that, out of four
pictures of womanly love, only one seems human and
natural, and that, the guilty love of Guinevère. The
recently awakened interest in the position of woman
is flooding the country with books relating to her and
her sphere. They have, their <em>very titles</em> have, an immense
educational influence. Let me direct your
attention to one published in Boston by a leading
house last winter, and entitled "Remarkable Women
of Different Ages and Nations." Let us read the
names of the thirteen women with whose lives it
seeks to entertain the public:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Beatrice Cenci, the parricide.<br />
Charlotte Corday, the assassin.<br />
Joanna Southcote, the English prophetess.<br />
Jemima Wilkinson, the American prophetess.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Madame Ursinus, the poisoner.<br />
Madame Göttfried, the poisoner.<br />
Mademoiselle Clairon, the actress.<br />
Harriet Mellon, the actress.<br />
Madame Lenormand, the fortune-teller.<br />
Angelica Kauffman, the artist.<br />
Mary Baker, the impostor.<br />
Pope Joan, the pontiff.<br />
Joan of Arc, the warrior.</p></blockquote>

<p>Look at the list! Assassins, parricides, and poisoners,
fortune-tellers, and actresses! Let us hope they
will always remain <em>remarkable</em>! In this list we have
the name of one woman who never lived, and of four
at least who in this country would owe all their celebrity
to the police court; and this while history pants
to be delivered of noble lives not known at all, like
the women of the House of Montefeltro, or little
known, like the pure and heroic wife of Condé, Clemence
de Maillé. And by what black art, let us ask,
are such names as Beatrice, and Charlotte Corday,
sweet Joan of Arc, and dear Angelica Kauffman, a
noble woman, whose happiness was wrecked upon
a fiendish jest, juggled into this list? As well might
you put Brutus who killed great Cæsar, and Lucretia
of spotless fame, and Andrea del Sarto who loved a
faithless wife, into the same category. Such association,
however false, helps to educate the popular
mind.</p>

<p>Of the power of adages, and that barbaric experience
and civilization of which they are generally the
exponent, we might write volumes; but the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
must be dismissed in this connection without a word.
We must pass on to consider the force of social instincts
and prejudices which underlie this general
literature, and are as much stronger than it as the
character of a man is stronger than his intellectual
quality. A lecturer once said, "that the first prejudice
which women have to encounter is one which exists
before they are born, which leads fathers instinctively
to look forward to the birth of sons, and to leave little
room in their happy or ambitious schemes for the
coming of a daughter." Not long since, a highly
educated Englishman told me that this remark smote
him to the heart. "I never expected to have any
thing but a son," he declared; "and, when my little
Minnie was born, I had made no preparation for her.
I had neither a thought nor a scheme at her service."</p>

<p>Fanny Wright, in some essays published thirty
years ago, says, "There are some parents who take
one step in duty, and halt at the second. Our sons,"
they say, "will have to exercise political rights, and fill
public offices. We must help them to whatever
knowledge there is going, and make them as sharp-witted
as their neighbors. As for our daughters, they
can never be any thing; in fact, they are nothing.
We give them to their mothers, who will take them to
church and dancing-school, and, with the aid of fine
clothes, fit them out for the market.</p>

<p>"But," she goes on to say, "let possibilities be what
they will, no man has a <em>right</em> to calculate on them for
his sons. He has only to consider them as human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
beings, and insure them a full development of all the
faculties which belong to them as such. So, as respects
his daughters, he has nothing to do with the
injustice of law, nor the absurdities of society. His
duty is plain,&mdash;to train them up as human beings, to
seek for them, and with them, all just knowledge.
Who among <em>men</em> contend best with the difficulties of
life and society,&mdash;the strong-minded or the weak, the
wise or the foolish? Who best control and mould
opposing circumstances,&mdash;the educated or the ignorant?
What is true of them is true of women also."</p>

<p>In the customs of nations, women find the most
discouraging educational influences. While with us
these customs all set one way, they are easily broken
through by the untutored races, who still rely on the
force of their primal instincts. When Captain Wallis
went to see the Queen of Otaheite, a marsh which
crossed the way proved a formidable obstacle to the
puny Anglo-Saxon. No sooner did the queen perceive
it, than, taking him up as if he were a meal-bag,
she threw him over her shoulder, and strode along.
Nobody smiled; even Captain Wallis does not appear
to have felt mortified. These people were accustomed
to the physical strength of their queen. It would
be well if civilized nations could imitate them, far
enough at least to remember, that wherever strength,
whether mental or physical, is found, <em>there</em> it certainly
belongs.</p>

<p>In Peru and the Formosa Isles, it is the women
who choose their husbands, and not the men who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
choose their wives; and, from the moment of marriage,
the man takes up his abode in his wife's family.
Lord of creation in every other respect, he still owes
to her whatever social standing and privileges he may
possess. Such an exception is valueless, save that it
shows us that sex does not absolutely, of itself, determine
such customs.</p>

<p>The African kings are permitted to have many
wives; but they respect the chastity of women, and
require it. Dr. Livingstone tells us of an instance in
which the royal succession finally lapsed upon a woman.
Her counsellors forbade her to marry a single
husband, telling her that it would create jealousies
and divisions in the tribe. She must follow the royal
custom. But pure womanly nature spoke louder than
the counsellors. The poor queen renounced marriage
altogether, and associated a half-brother in the government,
upon whose children she settled the succession.
Let this beautiful fact shame those coward souls who
fear to trust to the instinctive purity of the sex.</p>

<p>He goes on to state, in a recent letter, that he
has found nothing more remarkable, among the highly
intelligent tribes of the Upper Sambesi, than the respect
universally accorded to women.</p>

<p>"Many of the tribes are governed by a female chief.
If you demand any thing of a man," remarks the intrepid
explorer, "he replies, 'I will talk with my wife
about it.' If the woman consents, your demand is
granted. If she refuse, you will receive a negative
reply. Women vote in all the public assemblies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Among the Bushwanas and Kaffirs, the men swear by
their fathers; but among the veritable Africans, occupying
the centre of the continent, they always swear
by their mother. If a young man falls in love with a
maiden of another village, he leaves his own, and takes
up his dwelling in hers. He is obliged to provide in
part for the maintenance of his mother-in-law, and to
assume a respectful attitude, a sort of semi-kneeling,
in her presence. I was so much astonished at all
these marks of respect for women, that I inquired of
the Portuguese if such had always been the habit
of the country. They assured me that such had always
been the case."</p>

<p>If women were unwise managers of money,&mdash;a
statement frequently made, but which we may safely
deny,&mdash;it would be owing to the custom which has,
through long ages, put the purse in the hands of "their
master;" a custom so old, that to "husband" one's
resources is a phrase which expresses man's pecuniary
responsibility, and is always equivalent to locking
one's money up. "It will be time enough," says Mrs.
Kirkland, "to expect from woman a just economy
when she is permitted to distribute a portion of the
family resources. Witness those proud subscription-lists
where one reads, 'Mr. B., twenty dollars;' and,
just below, 'Mrs. B., ten dollars,'&mdash;which ten dollars
Mrs. B. never saw, and would ask for in vain to distribute
for her own pleasure."</p>

<p>And this custom has such educational force, that
very liberal men refuse the smallest pecuniary independence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to their wives to their very dying day.
"The Turk does not lock up his wife with more care
than the Christian his strong box. To that lock there
is ever but one key, and that the master carries in his
pocket. The case is not altered when the wife is about
to close her weary eyes in death. She may have
earned or inherited or saved the greater part of their
common property, but without his consent she cannot
bequeath a dollar." This passage reminds us of a
criticism on the marriage service attributed to Sir
John Bowring. This eccentric man considers it
wicked from beginning to end. "Look at it," he
says: "'with this ring I thee wed,'&mdash;that's sorcery;
'with my body I thee worship,'&mdash;that's idolatry;
'and with all my worldly goods I thee endow,'&mdash;that's
a lie!"</p>

<p>It is the long customs of mankind which stand in
the way of educating women to trades and professions.
These matters are mainly in woman's own
hands. One is glad to see in the English Parliament
certain statements made in this connection, and others
also in a London pamphlet on the nature of municipal
government. In reply to the common argument
that women ought not to enter certain vocations,
because they would ultimately find themselves incompetent,
it is stated, that, in all delicate handicrafts,
men do the same. Thus, of those who learn to make
watches and watchmakers' tools, not one-fifth continue
in the trade; and, in the decoration of that
delicate ware called Bohemian glass, by far the greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
portion of apprentices give it up on account of
natural unfitness.</p>

<p>It is the customs of society which sustain the prejudice
against literary women. When Dr. Aikin
published his "Miscellaneous Pieces," Fox met him in
the street. "I particularly admire," said the orator,
complimenting him, "your essay on Inconsistency."&mdash;"That,"
said Aikin, "is my sister's."&mdash;"Ah! well,
I like that on Monastic Institutions."&mdash;"That is also
hers," replied the honest man; and, in a tumult of
confusion, Fox bowed himself away. Had public
feeling been right, how gracefully he might have congratulated
the brother on his sister's ability, how gladly
might that brother have seen her excel himself! This
sister was that Mrs. Barbauld who afterward did such
womanly service, that we feel tempted to forgive
the early fit of sentimentality which found vent in
that rhymed nonsense, concluding,&mdash;</p>

<p>The manners of men have their educational influence.
The quiet turning-aside from women when
matters of business, politics, or science are discussed;
the common saying, "What have women to do with
that? let them mind their knitting, or their house
affairs;" the short answer when an interested question
is asked, "You wouldn't understand it, if I told
you,"&mdash;all these depress and enervate, and, even if
not <em>spoken</em>, the spirit of them animates all social life.
"Men are suspicious," wrote Dr. Alexander in 1790,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
"that a rational education would open the eyes of
women, and prompt them to assert the rights of which
they have always been deprived." But education
could not be withheld nor eyes closed for ever; therefore
the time has come to claim these rights. The
Sorbonne is already asked why it confers degrees
upon women with one hand, while it quietly locks
Margaret Fuller out of Arago's lecture-room with the
other. Need we inquire what influence it would have
upon society, if all literature and scientific opportunities,
if all societies devoted to natural history and
mathematics, if all colleges and public libraries the
world over, were thrown open to woman?</p>

<p>In inferior circles, where no leading minds preside,
it would be as it is now: there would be much idle
prating, much foolish delay, much inconsequent discussion;
but woman is quick to recognize genius, to
listen when wisdom speaks. She chatters, to be sure,
in the presence of fools; but, when earnest men come
to know the value of her enthusiasm, they will never
be willing to lose it. When the great door of the
scholarly and scientific retreat is once thrown open,
you will be surprised to see the crowd ready to enter;
and, when the sexes kindle into intellectual life together,
many a woman's coals will be modestly laid
upon an honored altar, and the flames will rise all the
higher because they have been so fed.</p>

<p>How can we estimate sufficiently the corrupting influence
of the newspapers of the land?</p>

<p>We may hope your prejudices will defend woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
here, and you will acknowledge that the minds cannot
be kept pure before whom their details are set. Let
us go farther, and say that they cannot be kept pure,
coming in contact as they do with minds among
men that gloat over such records. God is just, and
his compensations are terrible. If you do not spare
the purity of the lowest in the land, you cannot save
that of your wife and daughter. If you will not protect
the vulgar against themselves, you cannot protect
the refined against the vulgar. He is not a pure man,
who, among his fellows, thinks a thought or utters a
word he would blush to have his sister hear. She is
not a pure woman, who, in the seclusion of her
chamber, or gossip with her household, omits one of
the proprieties which delicacy requires. She has no
title to <em>our</em> respect, who is not secure in <em>her own</em>.
How can we reach such a standard as this, if we
invite pollution daily across our threshold, and call it
harmless because it dresses in printer's ink? It is
not enough that much of the obscenity is pure invention.
The profit of the scandal overbalances the cost
of the libel. The simplest item is turned to gross
account. Even the intimation that the postmaster
has placed a woman at the ladies' window in New
York has to be coupled with the insinuation that she
would have "done better at the gentlemen's." What
business have you or I with details that concern only
judge and jury? What good does it do society to
quote high legal authority upon "flirtation," unless,
indeed, we learn thereby to estimate aright the corrupting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
power of the first wrong step? Police reports,
vulgar anecdotes, shocking accidents, and trivial gossip
a child might be ashamed to repeat, make up the mass
of our daily sheets. Happy is the editor who offers
three columns of common sense daily to his readers.
When, alas! shall we have a public willing to pay for
common sense and pure reading alone?</p>

<p>A woman ought to turn like a flash of light from a
foul page, a coarse and vulgar word. No wit should
ever tempt her to read the one, or repeat the other;
and what I say of woman, I <em>mean</em> of man. I have
not two separate moral standards for the sexes.</p>

<p>Margaret Fuller speaks somewhere of certain habits
of impure speech which she had heard attributed to
ladies in a New-York hotel. What foundation that
story had, we may never find; but all of us know
some women before whom we keep the coldest reserve,
and with whom we would never touch many a
subject we should be willing to discuss with any pure-minded
man. Ladies! Not all the gold of Pactolus,
not all the beauty of Anadyomene, not all the wisdom
of Minerva, could make such women <em>ladies</em>! We
cannot redeem the poor denizens of Five Points till
we have redeemed those of the Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p>Our own children must prattle oaths, if we will not
hush the drunken brawler in the streets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;When this lecture was first delivered, in 1858, it excited more
discussion than any "revolutionary notions" of which I have ever been suspected.
Since then, the same ideas, as applied to other questions, have been
expressed in various quarters. I think a thorough classical education necessary
to a college bred man. As far as I have any opinions to express,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
they coincide with those recently uttered by John Stuart Mill at St. Andrew's.</p>

<p>I wish to sustain the remarks of the text by the following quotations:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Many things with the Greeks and Romans most venerable have not
merely lost their sanctity in our eyes, but present contemptible and even ludicrous
ideas to us. Hence, any allusion to them, or any expression of the feelings
connected with them, or even a reference to the habits of thinking which
those feelings have produced, must have an operation most unpropitious."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord
Brougham.</span></p>

<p>"The fictions constituting the epic poetry of Homer, Virgil, and their
imitators, so far from being consonant with the taste and sense of modern
readers, are, on the contrary, often annoying, from the absence of all moral
or poetical justice."&mdash;"The gods who preside in this scenic exhibition are
tainted with every vice which has since degraded their supposed subordinates
of the human race. Cruelty, revenge, deceit, hatred, unrelenting rancor, and
unbridled lust, are the qualities which call for approval in a generation professing
to feel and practise virtues of an opposite nature. An exterminating
war is undertaken for the sake of a vacillating adulteress, and its heroes
quarrel implacably about the possession of their female slaves. Ulysses, on his
return home, winds up the 'Odyssey' by a wholesale slaughter of his disorganized
subjects, hangs up a dozen censurable females in a row, and puts
Melanthius to a lingering death by gradual mutilation."&mdash;"In their social
relations, the Greeks were licentious and exquisitely depraved. In their
domestic habits, they were primitive, destitute, and uncleanly."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. Jacob
Bigelow.</span></p>

<p>These words represent the re-action of Christian morality against the
abuses of classical study, to which I allude in my text. But let the classics
be taught properly, and morality will have no complaint to make. We cannot
understand the history of the world, without an intelligent investigation
of its beginnings; but we should be carefully protected against assuming, as
reasonable and proper, either the habits and opinions or the sarcasms of an
extinct experience.</p></blockquote>

<p class="dropcap">WE have considered the controlling influence exercised
by consolidated public opinion concerning
women. We have asked from what sources
this opinion was derived. We have now to consider
some individual lives which have set it at defiance,
and in that way done something towards its reconstruction.</p>

<p>Mary Wollstonecraft is chiefly known in this country
as the wife of Godwin, and the author of a "Vindication
of the Rights of Woman." This book is
often accused of the most irreligious and libertine
tendencies; and, for many years, her name stood in
my own mind as the representative of an unfortunate
woman of genius, unbalanced in character, and only
to be remembered by the obstacles she had laid in the
path of her sex. I turned instinctively from the idea
I had somehow conceived of her; nor was it till a
singular literary fact, the exponent of her individual
power, arrested my attention, that I was tempted to
take up the "Rights of Woman."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>In making a rapid survey of English literature, to
ascertain how many women had made a decisive
mark upon it, and how many works had been published
especially bearing upon woman's advancement,
I at first experienced a bitter disappointment. Upon
approaching the year 1800, however, I found a stream
of literature rushing in, for which I could not account.
It united many rivulets of thought and life.
Some volumes were heavy and oppressive in a double
sense; some were light as pamphlets; some consisted
of translations from other languages; some were biographies;
many were attempts at reconstruction on
a rotten foundation; others, an attempt at the rebuilding
of society from its very base. But these
works all bore the same stamp, an impress powerful,
but healthy. It seemed as if one thought had animated
all these workers who had taken society by
surprise; for the prejudice and bigotry they must
have aroused had left no corresponding trace. The
prefaces generally began, "On account of the interest
lately excited," "The public mind seeming now to be
interested;" and I read very few volumes before I
discovered that the power which had aroused and interested
was no other than Mary Wollstonecraft's
"Rights of Woman."</p>

<p>These books ranged onward from 1790, and the
force of the influence was not spent for twenty years.
Among them, I recall, at this moment, Dr. Alexander's
"History of Women" in two quarto volumes; Matilda
Betham's "Biographical Dictionary," an <em>honest</em>, if not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
a valuable, attempt to supply a want still felt in
English literature; and Cotton's translation of the
mathematical works of Maria Agnesi. These were
born of a common mother. I read the "Vindication,"
therefore, with persistent care; looking with
fruitless question for the second and third volumes
that were promised. Could this be the book which
had been so abused for half a century? The American
edition had been published before garbling
became the fashion; but I took pains to collate it
carefully with the English. It was all in vain. I
found only a simple, determined, eloquent plea for a
proper education for women, urged on social, moral,
and religious grounds; an earnest protest against
Rousseau and Dr. Gregory; and a demand that <em>men</em>
should be subject to the same moral laws as women.
Very revolutionary this! Reprint it, under modern
sponsorship, and you would find it perhaps too heavy
to read. It would only repeat what you all know,
and you would miss the fanatical spice of our later
speech. Yet this book was so much needed when
it appeared, that it acted on the under-current of
English thought and life like a subsoil plough, and
brought all manner of abominations to the surface.
The preface alone contains any allusion to woman's
political rights. If is dedicated to Talleyrand, who,
in publishing a pamphlet on national education, had
admitted the inconsistency of debarring women from
their exercise. From this preface, the <em>world</em> took
fright, and <em>we</em> may judge in what manner she intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to follow up her plea for education. Let me quote
a few passages. "I earnestly wish," she says, "to
point out in what true dignity and human happiness
consist. I wish to persuade women to acquire
strength both of mind and body, and to convince
them, that the soft phrases, 'susceptibility of heart,'
'delicacy of sentiment,' and 'refinement of taste,'
are almost synonymous with epithets of weakness,
and that those beings who are the objects of pity, and
that kind of love which has been termed its sister,
will soon become objects of contempt."&mdash;"An air
of fashion is but a badge of slavery."&mdash;"It follows,"
she says farther on, "that women should either be
shut up, like Eastern princesses, or educated in such a
manner as to think and act for themselves."&mdash;"Suppose
a woman trained to obedience, married to a
sensible man, who directs her judgment, without permitting
her to feel the servility of her position. She
cannot ensure the life of her protector. He may
die, and leave her at the head of a large family."&mdash;"It
is not <em>empire</em>, but <em>equality</em>, woman should contend
for. When women are sufficiently enlightened to
discover their real interests, they will be very ready
to resign all those prerogatives of love <em>which are not
mutual</em> for the calm satisfactions of friendship and
the tender confidence of habitual esteem. Before
marriage, they will not assume any insolent airs,
nor afterwards abjectly submit; but, endeavoring to
act like reasonable creatures in both relations, they
will not be tumbled from a throne to a stool."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the character of the whole book. It contains
nothing more subversive of morality than these
words. You cannot do better than read it, and receive,
as I did, a lasting lesson on the folly of prejudice. As
a work of art, it is irregular in method, and impulsive
in execution; facts not to be wondered at, since
it was written and printed in the brief space of six
weeks. Dr. Channing once wrote of her: "I have
lately read Mary Wollstonecraft's posthumous works.
Her letters towards the close of the first volume are
the best I ever read. They are superior to Sterne's.
I consider her the greatest woman of the age. Her
'Rights of Woman' is a masculine performance, and
ought to be studied by her sex; the sentiments are
noble and generous."</p>

<p>What, then, was the character of the woman? Was
it as strong and generous as the sentiments she advocated?
Her life broke down some social barriers,
and, though noble and heroic when viewed from
within, looks hampered and unsatisfactory from the
common stand-point. Godwin has erected an exquisite
monument to her memory, in a sketch written
soon after her decease. Mary Wollstonecraft
was born near London in the year 1759. She
came into an unhappy and uncongenial home. Her
father was a passionate tyrant; her mother, compelled
to submit to his caprice, became like every other
slave, a tyrant where she had the power, and ruled
her children with a rod of iron. By defending her
mother from her husband's violence, Mary early extorted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
some degree of affection from the one, and
respect from the other. Her father had some property,
which he seems to have squandered by frequent
changes of abode; and a day school at Beverley, in
Yorkshire, gave her her principal advantages of education.
An eccentric clergyman at Hoxton, named
Clare, added some farther instruction. Under his
roof, she formed an intimacy with Frances Blood,
destined to influence her whole life. This girl was
remarkably accomplished, and, at the age of eighteen,
supported her father and mother and their family
of younger children. She was delicately neat and
proper in all she did; and her influence was of the
greatest benefit to Mary, who had often desired to
assist her family, but was deterred by the helpless
condition of her mother. She now went as companion
to a family at Bath, but soon relinquished the
position, on account of her mother's serious illness.
Mrs. Wollstonecraft was exacting and troublesome.
Mary nursed her with devoted care, but, after her
death, bade a final farewell to her father's roof. His
affairs had become wretchedly involved; and, with
Fanny Blood and her two sisters, she proceeded
to open a day school. At first, she had looked
upon Fanny as her superior, but her own force
of character soon found its rightful position. The
health of her friend broke down under her unnatural
burden, and Mary's devotion to her for years was
beautiful to see. Her marriage and removal to Lisbon,
in a vain search for health, soon put this devotion
to the test.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>At this point, Mary Wollstonecraft's reputation
was unsullied. She was an admirable manager, an
efficient and successful teacher; yet, when Fannie became
seriously ill, she did not hesitate to risk her only
means of support, the prosperity of her school, to go
to her. Her friend, Dr. Price, the Unitarian minister,
and Mrs. Burgh, were annoyed at what they considered
a quixotic devotion; but they supplied her with
money, and she went. A few days closed in death
an intimacy of more than ten years, which had been,
until this time, Mary's tenderest interest in life. On
her way home, her moral energy saved the lives of a
French crew in a sailing vessel which she encountered,
just about to founder. Her school had suffered
by her absence; and the pressing necessities of Fanny's
family, in which she still took an interest, induced
her to have recourse to literature. The first
ten pounds received from her "Thoughts on the Education
of Daughters" went to their relief. Nothing
can be sadder than to see a young girl placed as
Mary Wollstonecraft now was,&mdash;compelled to fulfil
the duties of a father and mother to younger brothers
and sisters. The position is unnatural. Gratitude
might be expected, but envy is more often felt. The
personal advantages sought for their sakes, and not
to be transferred except as a pecuniary profit, she is
supposed to seek for her own. Affection partly yields,
and enthusiasm does not replace it; while she is
urged by necessities which make it difficult to bear
the errors and intractabilities of those she is providing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
for. Still loving, and desiring to provide for her sisters,
Mary thought it better to live apart from them,
and accepted a temporary position as governess in
Lord Kingsborough's family. When they left England,
she went to Bristol, and published a novel,
which, founded on her ten years of friendly devotion,
took the highest rank as a work of sentiment.
The next three years were spent in her own
house, in London, in the active service of the publisher,
Johnson. She translated from French, German,
and Italian, wrote several books for children,
and took a large share in the conduct of the "Analytical
Review."</p>

<p>Her translation of Salzman's "Elements of Morality"
led to an interesting correspondence with its
author, who repaid the service, subsequently, by
translating into German her "Rights of Woman."
These occupations, if they did little towards the discipline
of her powers, served to rouse her from the
dejection into which the death of her friend had
plunged her. Her earnings were now devoted to her
own family. One sister she kept at Paris for two
years to qualify her as a governess; another she
placed as parlor-boarder at a London school. Her
brother James she sent to Woolwich; afterward procuring
for him a position in the navy, where he soon
rose to be a lieutenant. Her favorite, Charles, she
placed with a farmer for instruction; and then fitted
him out for America, where he grew wealthy on the
basis she provided. This brother must have left a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
large family in the State of New York. Her brothers
and sisters thus established, she attempted to rescue
a support for her father from his broken and confused
fortunes. This proving impossible, he was supported
by her own labor, until his death. The very great
demands made upon her by such natural obligations
did not prevent her from assuming others. She
adopted for her own the child of a dead friend, the
niece of John Hunter. Her brilliancy, her personal
beauty, her unselfish devotion, could not fail to win
for her many loving friends; and among them the
French Revolution found her. The work which first
gave her her proper literary rank was her answer to
Burke's Reflections upon that movement. She wrote
rapidly: her pamphlet was the first of the many that
appeared, and obtained extraordinary success. The
public applause warmed her, and her next production
was her celebrated "Vindication of the Rights of
Woman." The startling energy with which she exploded
the system of gallantry, a miserable relic of
the Stuart courts, roused the popular indignation. It
was hard to reconcile the vigor of her rebuke to the
tender sentiment which trembled through the book,
and also to the impression produced by Mary herself,
lovely in person, and, in the most engaging sense,
feminine in her manners. Her intimacy with the historical
painter, Fuseli, followed. He was a man of
powerful genius and strong prejudices. His influence
upon Mary, if it was sometimes refreshing,
could not always have been beneficial. The reader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of Haydon's Autobiography will remember this man.
A wider knowledge of the world would have protected
her from his influence: as it was, she pursued
the intimacy with unsuspecting delight; for
Fuseli was a contented husband, and his wife was
her friend. She was now in her thirty-second year;
she had arrived at a period when domestic happiness
of some sort becomes essential to the strongest
woman. The fullest-fruited laurel then withers before
her eyes, if it has not taken root at her own
hearth. At the close of the year 1792, Mary took
refuge in Paris from the chagrin and restlessness
which began to oppress her. Her years of toil had
left her sad and lonely: she needed to rest for a little
while in human affection. She could not even write
to her own satisfaction; for her morbid fatigue led
her to reproduce Fuseli's cynicism, and she dared not
trust herself. She entered the best circles of Parisian
society, and became intimate with the leaders of the
Revolution. In four months after her arrival occurred
the most untoward event of her life,&mdash;her
marriage to a worthless American named Gilbert
Imlay; a name rescued from oblivion only by his
temporary attachment to her. I say her <em>marriage</em>, for
Imlay offered himself in marriage, and was accepted
as a husband; but, taking advantage of a custom not
unusual at Paris in those disorderly times, Mary refused
to consummate the legal forms. Mr. Imlay had
no property. Mary had a large family to support;
and she neither wished to become answerable for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
his debts, nor to make him responsible for hers. She
took the name of Imlay; and, expecting to follow her
brother to America, she obtained from our ambassador
at Paris a certificate of American citizenship, to
serve as a temporary protection. In order that you
may comprehend the precise significance which this
step had in that place and at that time, let me remind
you, that Helen Maria Williams, her personal friend,
and the ward of Dr. Rees of cyclopedic memory, was
married in the same way to a Mr. Edwards, then in
Paris. She was a well-known writer of that period;
and we are still indebted to her for some of the best
hymns sung in our churches,&mdash;among them, that
well-known hymn, beginning, "While thee I seek,
protecting Power." But her husband was worthy of
the trust she had reposed in him, and she never
turned a ready pen against the follies of society: so
<em>her</em> character has never stood in the public stocks.</p>

<p>It will be impossible to consider Mary's attachment
to Imlay in any degree rational, if we look only
at her <em>character</em>, and keep out of sight her peculiar
personal <em>history</em>.</p>

<p>The dawdling inefficiency and brutal temper of her
father had disgusted her alike with "men of spirit"
and "men of straw." In her husband, she saw, as she
thought, a certain democratic manliness; and his daring
speculations seemed to be inspired by courage
and genius. The affections which had been roused
by her admiring intercourse with Fuseli kindled
gladly on this new shrine, where no social duty, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
stern sense of personal honor, contended against her
warming fancy. For the first time in her life, she
found herself happy; and happiness gave her back
the beauty of early youth. She was playful, gentle,
sympathetic. Her eyes had new brightness, her
cheeks new color, and the bewitching tenderness of
her smile fascinated the very women who approached
her. She had been married eighteen months, her
love braving all the trials that must have come, when
Imlay left her for London. She had expected his
quick return; but delay followed delay, and Mary
passed a year with a new-born child, learning, by
slow and painful degrees, that she had trusted this
man beyond his worth. At last, he sent for her to
London, where his misconduct affected her mind to
such an extent, that she twice attempted her own life,
and was rescued the second time with difficulty. As
soon as she recovered from the fever which had induced
delirium, her native strength told her what she
ought to do. Imlay had business in Norway, which
required a confidential and judicious agent. She
determined to take this upon herself; and hoped, by
absence and success, to regain the affection she had
lost. The man was, in no sense, worthy of her. On
her return, she tried, for the sake of their child, to
remain in the same house with him. It was not possible;
and, very soon, a final separation took place.
It would have taken place long before, but that Imlay
was a man who could not wholly escape from a fascination
he had once felt. After he became involved in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
low connections, he could never re-enter her presence,
without resuming, for the time, the sympathetic delicacy
befitting her lover. During all this time, Mary
had occupied herself with literary work. She never
spoke of Imlay, and would allow no one to blame
him in her presence. Conscious of her own upright
intentions, it must have been no small mortification to
find her insight and generosity baffled. She felt that
she was herself to blame for having placed an impulsive
man in a position to which he was wholly unequal.
She was everywhere received and treated as
a married woman, and lost none of the respect and
affection she had well deserved. In April, 1797, she
was married to Godwin, the author of "St. Leon;"
and this marriage deprived her of two new friends,
whom she held very dear. Godwin was so artless,
that he imagined his wife's social position would be
improved by an honorable marriage; but it obliged
Mrs. Inchbald and Mrs. Siddons to admit that the
nature of her marriage to Imlay allowed her to take
her divorce into her own hands.</p>

<p>Wonderful inconsistency of society, which, having
interpreted truly her upright nature through years of
desertion, now condemned her,&mdash;whether for her first
wrong step, for assuming her own divorce, or for
loving a man of undoubted probity, who could tell?
A short year of undisturbed happiness followed, when
the birth of their only child&mdash;the late Mrs. Shelley&mdash;suddenly
put an end to her life.</p>

<p>A beautiful memorial survives her, in these words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of her husband. "This light," he says, "was lent me
for a very little while, and it is now extinguished for
ever. The strength of Mary's mind lay in her intuition.
In a robust and unwavering judgment of this sort,
there is a kind of witchcraft. When it decides justly,
it produces a responsive vibration in every ingenuous
mind. In this sense, my oscillation and scepticism
were often fixed by her boldness." I am very well
aware how much courage is required of any woman
who shall seem to defend Mary Godwin from the
popular conception of her. I know that the woman
should herself be spotless who would attempt to rectify
that conception, yet two circumstances seem to
compel explanation. In the first place, there is no
question, that if the views of woman which are now
beginning to move society originated with her scholarly,
republican friend, Mrs. Catharine Macaulay,
yet the fire and eloquence of Mary's own words were
needed to give them currency. Society has been just
so far as this, that it has identified her with the subject
of "Woman's Rights;" and all of us who are
carried forward by a momentum which she imparted,
must desire to understand the nature of the impulse
which controls us.</p>

<p>In the second place, Godwin's short Life of her has
been long out of print, and has now become very
rare; and I have not been able to find a single encyclopædia
or biographical dictionary which gives the
facts correctly. Turn to them, and you will find that
Mary Wollstonecraft had a criminal but fruitless attachment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
for Fuseli; that she formed another, of <em>the
same kind</em>, for an American, who deserted her. I brand
these statements as malicious falsehoods, carelessly
repeated now that they have been long exploded:
and, as I write these statements, the tears rush to my
eyes; for where are the descendants of the brothers
and sisters whom she reared? where are the kindred
of Fannie Blood and John Hunter, whose lives her
generous efforts gladdened? Nay, might not one
man of the drowning crew she forced the captain of
her ship to rescue, speak a noble word in her behalf?
I have narrated her life with some detail, for you
must understand the facts upon which you pass judgment;
and these details are many of them gathered
from private sources.</p>

<p>To understand the strength of the prejudice against
Mary Wollstonecraft, you should see that from all the
autobiographies of the period her name is excluded;
as if the friends of those who had been intimate with
her while living, would not permit the association of
names after death. I have said, that, until her marriage
to Godwin, she kept her place in English
society; and women of the most sensitive propriety,
such as Mrs. Siddons and Mrs. Inchbald, admitted
her to their intimacy. How, then, did such a prejudice
grow up? It was probably forming in the popular
mind while she was happy in the affection of her
friends; and, the moment they found it conventionally
needful to sacrifice her, the outbreak was unrestrained.
In the first place, she was an ardent republican; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
thing no less antagonistic to English feeling in her
day, than we have seen it prove in ours. In the
second, she was a Unitarian; and Unitarians were
radicals in politics as well as in religion. In the third
place, being a republican, and a resident of Paris in
its troubled times, she was supposed to share the
disorder of its morals; an impression which her attempted
suicides no doubt confirmed.</p>

<p>We shall not share in this country in any prejudice
which republicanism or Unitarianism excited. We
are, I trust, ready to admit that an attempt at suicide
could only come with delirium, for which she would
be as free from responsibility as for a typhoid fever
or an Asiatic cholera. What we have to do, then, is
to understand her relation to the laws of marriage,
and to see how far her second marriage can be justified.
When she met Imlay at Paris, I do not think
she had ever considered the social bearing of these
laws, except so far as her mother's experience had
pained her. That experience made her willing to do
what other women about her were doing, with no bad
result that she could see, to keep herself free from
pecuniary entanglement. In one way, this was prudent;
in an other way, it was extremely imprudent;
and the imprudence touched a more vital point than
the prudence: but that it was never considered criminal
by wise and candid judges, that she was never
compromised in any relation up to this, the intimacies
we have recorded prove. Had she been a weak, <em>immoral</em>
woman, she would have continued to live with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Imlay for her child's sake, but availing herself of
the shelter of a connection from which she recoiled.
At this moment, she wrote to her husband, "Your
reputation shall not suffer. I shall never have a confidant.
I am content with the approbation of my
own mind; and, if there be a Searcher of hearts, mine
will not be rejected." And again: "My child may
have reason to blush for her mother's want of prudence;
but she shall never despise me." These are
not the words of a weak or irreligious woman. So
far, then, all was well, except that society had no
efficient outlawry for the man who had deserted her.
She still occasionally met him, but bore the unexpected
trial, when it came, with dignity and sweetness.
When Godwin sought her in marriage, he knew, of
course, that no legal ties bound her. Mary saw no
harm in using the liberty that remained to her.
"Why could she not have remained single?" said
the world; but had the world been so just and kind
to her, that we could expect her to resist the influence
of a generous and courageous love? Had she lived
in this country, and been divorced by the laws of
Indiana, society would have been silent; but the real
evil would have been the same.</p>

<p>"Never did there exist a woman," said her husband,
"who might with less fear expose her actions,
and call upon the universe to judge them." I believe
this to be true so far as her own relations were
concerned; and I believe, that, by her second marriage,
she meant to exercise a right of protest against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
existing laws, which two of the most gifted children
of the nineteenth century have exercised again in our
own time with emphasis. It requires a philosophic
mind to see the relation of the individual to the
state: heroic, indeed, is the spirit which, perceiving it,
braves the common expectation by a defiant life. On
the other hand, it is by no prejudice that we demand
this account of each person's private affairs. It is
a demand born of an ill-defined, dimly entertained,
but still a just idea of the relations of God, the
family, and the state. I ought not to say so much,
without adding that no one in this country can adequately
judge of the pressure of the marriage laws
as they still exist in England. What is resisted, is,
in most instances, what no American woman would
be expected to bear; but for England, as for this
country, I rest in the confident hope that a right
adjustment of woman's relation to society will
change healthfully all existing legislation. Such legislation
as that of Indiana does not seem to me an
advance, although it may have been demanded by
an <em>advancing</em> public sentiment.</p>

<p>I have said this honestly, with a tender pity in my
heart, to clear the memory of a much-abused woman.
Does any one ask me if I would justify the position in
which she stood? I answer, frankly, No. We do not
live to ourselves alone; and if we are ever tempted
to take a step against the moral convictions of the
world, believing that we can do as we will with our
own, one would think the possibility that children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
may be born to inherit the obloquy we excite, without
themselves deserving it, would be enough to deter
any right-minded woman. No love or care, or abject
self-sacrifice, can reconcile a child to the stain of illegitimacy.
"What does the Lord thy God require of
thee?"&mdash;"To do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly."
It is not walking humbly to set up our own
conception of fitness against the accumulated experience
of mankind. Still farther: It is of very little
importance what others may think of us, when we
are acting conscientiously; but what we think of
others, our own mood of mind towards God and
man,&mdash;that is of the very greatest.</p>

<p>The influence of the "Vindication of the Rights
of Woman" was greatly aided by the efforts of Mr.
Day, and of Maria Edgeworth, whose literary career
began about the time of its publication. Following
closely upon these, and so nearly parallel in effort,
and equal in varied ability, that we hardly know in
what order to name them, are Lady Morgan, Harriet
Martineau, and Mrs. Jameson. Sydney Morgan, sitting
alone at the age of fourscore in her tiny house at
Dublin, filled like a museum with the accumulation
of her years of travel, projecting the publication of her
last work, was lately, like Mrs. Somerville at Florence,
a pensioner of Queen Victoria. But, from the hour
of her first appearance as the author of the "Wild
Irish Girl," she has exercised a generous womanly
influence. Under the disguise of novels, books of
travel, and the like, she has published an immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
number of volumes, filled with information which
may be a little too crowded for convenience, but
always accurate, always original, and, for the most
part, received from historic sources, in personal intercourse.
Her warm hatred of tyranny made friends
for her, wherever she went. When a young girl, she
took up the cause of her own country with a vehemence
which won the liberal party, and made her
fashionable before she was approved. "The wild
Irish girl" and her harp were essential to the success
of every entertainment; and invitations lay two or
three deep for every evening. She entered society
with beauty, wit, and prestige. She might have done
what she would. She chose to remain faithful to unpopular
opinions. After her marriage to Sir Charles
Morgan, they went, for economical reasons, to the
Continent, where they eventually spent many years.
In France, Lafayette, Ségur, Dénon, and L'Aguisseau
were her intimate friends; and in the <em>salon</em> of the
Princess de Salm she was always a welcome guest.
In Germany, Flanders, and Italy, not only the liberal
youth, but the learned eld, crowded her apartments,
gave her minute information, and became devoted
cicerones. The friendship of cardinals and princes
did not dim her natural democracy of view; and her
last words were as true to liberty as her first. Her
works on France and Italy were proscribed in both
countries; yet "Young France" and "Young Italy"
contrived to obtain and read them. She came into
fashion in Paris whenever the Bourbons went out;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and, when she dined with Rothschild, his famous
cook acknowledged her friendship for the people in
autographs of spun sugar! "We shall meet at the
breakfast of the Austrian ambassador," said a Parisian
fop, as he made his bow. "Not we," she laughed
in answer: "it would be as much as his place is
worth to ask me." Wherever she went, and whatever
she did, her ears were always open to a woman's
name; and, with the most loyal interest, she gathered
up every thing relating to their lives, their influence,
and their disabilities. What she was told as
gossip, was retained, studied out, and digested, before,
with the piquancy of a French woman and the
warmth of an Irish, it was given to the world. The
first two volumes of her "History of Woman" do not
touch a period of universal interest; but, had she been
able to complete the work, it would have exhausted
the subject. In the Béguine, she says: "Women
meddle with politics as well as tent-stitch, and, like
Madame de Maintenon, bring their work-bags to the
Privy Council, and direct the affairs of Europe while
they trace patterns for footstools. The influence of
woman will ever be exercised directly or indirectly
in all good or evil. It is a part of the scheme
of nature. Give her, then, such light as she is
capable of receiving. Educate her, whatever her
station, for taking her part in society. Her ignorance
has often made her interference fatal; her knowledge,
never." The cordial sympathy of her husband
has made Lady Morgan's life beautiful. His legal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
knowledge and antiquarian taste added their own
charm to whatever she undertook.</p>

<p>How great and worthy is the literary position of
Harriet Martineau, we all know. Its retro-actionary
influence in favor of the ability and freedom
of her sex is what we are to indicate here. For
whatever immediate purpose she writes, her words
bear indirectly on the widest womanly emancipation.
May this remark stimulate your curiosity,
and keep you on the alert for pregnant sentences!
Such sentences tell more of the progress of human
thought than some of us suspect: they indicate its
natural, habitual poise. "Women especially," she
writes, "should be allowed the free use of whatever
strength their Maker has seen fit to give them. It
is essential to the virtue of society, that they should
be allowed the freest moral action, unfettered by
ignorance, and unintimidated by authority; for it is
an unquestioned and unquestionable fact, that, if
women were not weak, men would not be wicked,
and that, if women were bravely pure, there would
be an end of the dastardly tyranny of licentiousness."
This passage will have all the more power over observant
readers, because it occurs unexpectedly, and
marks the opportunity seized to speak a necessary
if unwelcome truth.</p>

<p>What noble service Mrs. Jameson rendered in
the field of art or letters did not leave her indifferent
to the interests of her sex. She was placed in
circumstances to make her see quickly and feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
deeply all that relates to womanly position and
development. An early martyr to the prejudices of
society; married, I think at sixteen, to a man far
beyond her own rank in life, who left her at the
altar,&mdash;she bore the title of wife, and led the life
of a celibate: but her first word for her sex was as
strong and true as her last, while her own path lay
between lines of living fire. Only lately did we
hear of her as a lecturer and reformer; but, nearly
thirty years ago, we might have cut from her pages
the following words: "We are told openly by
moralists and politicians, that it is for the general
good of society, nay, an absolute necessity, that one-fifth
part of the female sex should be condemned
as the legitimate prey of the other, predoomed to
die in reprobation in the streets, in hospitals, that
the virtue of the rest may be preserved, and the pride
and the passions of men both satisfied. But I have
a bitter pleasure in thinking, that this most base and
cruel conventional law is avenged upon those who
made and uphold it; that here the sacrifice of a
certain number of one sex to the permitted license
of the other is no general good, but a general curse,
a very ulcer in the bosom of society." Can you
guess how brave and pure a woman was needed
to write those words? All the indirect tendency of
her works is in keeping with them; and we recognize
the same voice, as she said in a later lecture:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When female nurses were to be sent to the
Crimea, there was to be met the mockery of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
light-minded, the atrocious innuendoes of the dissolute,
the sneers of the ignorant, and the scepticism
of the cold. I have seen men who deem it quite a
natural and proper thing that women&mdash;<em>some women</em>
at least&mdash;should lead the life of a courtesan, put
on a look of offended propriety at the idea of a
woman nursing a sick soldier. I have seen men&mdash;ay,
and women too&mdash;who deem it a matter of course
that our streets should be haunted by contagious vice,
disgusted at the idea of women turning apothecaries
and <i xml:lang="fr">hôpitalières</i>. And, worse than all, I have heard
men&mdash;and women too&mdash;who acknowledge the gospel
of Christ, who call themselves by his name, who
believe in his mission of mercy, disputing about the
exact shade of orthodoxy in a woman who had offered
up every faculty of her being at the feet of the Redeemer."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Remember that these words were spoken where
they belonged, in the very heart of Belgravia, to the
very people who deserved them, and respect the brave
purity which compelled lips as well as pen to utterance.
It would scarce be honest not to say, in this
connection, that Mrs. Jameson took some pains, so
long as she lived, to separate herself from the American
Woman's-Rights party&mdash;a party, it may be, only
represented to her by the vulgar pretension of travelling
Bloomers. Some of us take comfort in remembering
how much more easily the misrepresentations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of the press, or the intrusions of unfit subjects on
womanly discussion, will float across the wide Atlantic,
than our weightier works. When she said, in the
same breath, concerning a decree of the French Consulate,
"I confess, I should like to see a decree of <em>our</em>
Parliament beginning with a recognition that women
do exist as a part of the community, whose responsibilities
are to be acknowledged, and whose capabilities
are to be made available, not separately, but conjointly
with those of men," we know that she worked for
us and with us, and forgive the want of recognition
in gratitude for the real service.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaskell has perhaps done more than any
woman of this century, not confessedly devoted to
our cause, to elevate the condition of her sex, and
disseminate liberal ideas as to their needs and culture.
The first part of her career was one of those brilliant
successes which startle us into surprise and admiration.
It was checked midway by the publication of
her life of Charlotte Bronté, the best and noblest of
her works. Checked, because condemned in that
instance without a hearing, she could never afterwards
feel the elastic pleasure which was natural to
her in composing and printing; and, for three long
years afterwards, never touched her pen. I would not
allude to this subject, if every notice of her, since her
death, had not done so; repeating the old censure,
as a matter of course. Here in America, we exculpate
her. The public was wrong, in the first place,
inasmuch as it has come to demand biography before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
biography is possible. The publisher was wrong, in
the second; for he ought to have known, and could
easily have ascertained, how plain a statement the
English law would permit. The public was still further
wrong, when it attributed misapprehension and
carelessness to a woman whom it very well knew to
be incapable of either. I, for one, shall never forgive
nor forget the officious censure given by one who
must have known that the legal apology tendered, in
Mrs. Gaskell's absence, to protect her pecuniary interests,
had the unfortunate effect to put her in a position
where explanation and self-defence were alike
impossible. Mrs. Gaskell had deserved the steady
confidence of the public.</p>

<p>I have kept till the last the name of Fredrika Bremer,
whose good fortune it was to secure lasting benefits
to her sex. God sent to her early years dark trials
and privations. Her father's tyrannical hand crushed
all power and loveliness out of her life. At first, she
rebelled against her sufferings; but, when he died in
her girlhood, she was able to see that they lent strength
to her efforts for her sex. It was the rumor of what
we are doing in this country for women that first
drew her hither. It is not the fashion for Miss Bremer's
friends fully to recognize her position in this
respect. I owe my own convictions on the subject of
suffrage to the reflections she awakened. When I
told her that my mind was undecided on this point,
she showed her disappointment so plainly, that I
was forced to reconsider the whole subject. Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Bremer did not hurry her work: she had a serene
confidence that she should be permitted to finish what
she had begun. She secured popularity by her cheerful
humor, her genuine feeling, her true appreciation
of men, and her insight into the conditions of family
happiness, before she made any direct appeal against
existing laws. Those who will read her novels thoughtfully,
however, will see that she was, from the first,
intent upon making such an effort possible. From
the beginning, she pleaded for the social independence
of wives; asked for them a separate purse;
showed that woman could not even give her love
freely, until she was independent of him to whom she
owed it. To a just state of society, to noble family
relations, entire freedom is essential.</p>

<p>Under her influence, females had been admitted to
the Musical Academy. The directors of the Industrial
School at Stockholm had attempted to form a class,
and Professor Quarnstromm had opened his classes
at the Academy of Fine Arts to women. Cheered
by her sympathy, a female surgeon had sustained herself
in Stockholm; and Bishop Argardh indorsed the
darkest picture she had ever drawn, when he pleaded
with the state to establish a girls'-school. It was at
this juncture that Miss Bremer published "Hertha."
This book was a direct blow aimed at the laws of
Sweden concerning women. By this time, she had
herself become, in Sweden, what we might fitly call a
"crowned head." She was everywhere treated with
distinction; and her sudden appearance in any place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
was greeted with the enthusiasm usually shown by
such nations only to their princes. She said of her
new book, "I have poured into it more of my heart
and life than into any thing which I have ever written;"
and verily she had her reward. She was at
Rome, two years after,&mdash;in 1858,&mdash;when the glad
news reached her, that King Oscar, at the opening of
the Diet, had proposed a bill entitling women to hold
independent property at the age of twenty-five. All
Sweden had read the book which moved the heart of
the king; and the assembled representatives rent the
air with their acclamations.</p>

<p>In the following spring, the old University town of
Upsala, where her friend Bergfalk occupies a chair,
granted the <em>right of suffrage</em> to fifty women owning
real estate, and to thirty-one doing business on their
own account. The representative whom their votes
went to elect was to sit in the House of Burgesses.
Miss Bremer was not ashamed to shed happy tears
when this news reached her. If she had ever reproached
Providence with the bitter sorrow of her
early years, she was penitent and grateful now. Then
was fulfilled the prophecy which she had uttered, as she
left our shores, "The nation which was first among
Scandinavians to liberate its slaves, shall also be the
first to emancipate its women."</p>

<p>This is not the place to unfold the delicate sheaths
of meaning with which flower-like Robert Browning
invests his thought; but the man who wrote the
"Blot on the Scutcheon," and the exquisite sketch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
of "Pippa Passes," has done such justice to the sex,
and so far helped the cause of right feeling and right
thinking in respect to some of the most delicate
problems that concern it, that we are compelled to
speak of him gratefully. His marriage, too, is still
fragrant; a full-fruited flower of promise to the world,
which makes us see the best things possible, and believe
that the time is coming when man and woman
will not seldom stand before the altar as equal and
individual, yet sacredly one. To Elizabeth Browning,
to whom was given in her life that place of
pre-eminence among women which Shakespere must
always hold among men, we owe grateful thanks,
for the scholarly achievement, the conscientious study,
the womanly zeal, which distinguished all her work.
When theology sometimes wrestled with poetry in
her speech, we translated it into a freer tongue, and
thanked her all the same. In "Aurora Leigh" she
stabbed every conventional falsity to the heart, and
held the ear tenaciously till she had delivered all her
oracle.</p>

<p>Yet these were all to a certain extent indirect influences.
Can I utter without trembling the two
names which sit upon the thrones of female power
in the Old World and the New? I mean Charlotte
Bronté and Margaret Fuller. I wish I could confer a
proper emphasis upon my words, when I say that the
publication of "Jane Eyre" formed the chief era in
the literature of women since that literature began.
Into it was compressed all the feeling and experience
of a very remarkable life,&mdash;feeling and experience entertained
without the smallest sense of responsibility
to the conventional world. The life of the
author touched the restrictions of society, as the
spheral curves touch the tangents which square them,
so slightly as never to impair its wonderful individuality.
Who would not seek a wife like Jane Eyre?
Who does not rejoice in the smallest detail of that
sparkling and varied courtship? Think of those
words of Rochester, when, holding her with the grasp
of a madman, he says, "Never was any thing at
once so frail and so indomitable. A mere reed she
feels in my hand. I could bend her with my finger
and thumb. And what good would it do, if I bent,
if I uptore, if I crushed her? Consider that eye;
consider the wild, resolute, free thing looking out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of it, defying me with more than courage,&mdash;with
a stern triumph. Whatever I do with its cage,
I cannot get at it, the savage beautiful creature!
If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage
will only set the captive free. Conqueror I might
be of the house; but the inmate would escape to
heaven, before I could call myself possessor of its
clay dwelling-place. And it is you, spirit, with will
and energy and virtue and purity, that I want, not
alone your brittle frame."</p>

<p>And from what literature, of ancient or modern
growth, shall we match Jane's answer, when passion
presses, crying, "Who in the world cares for you? or
who will be injured by what <em>you</em> do?"</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> care for <em>myself</em>," is the indomitable reply: "the
more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained,
I am, the more I will respect myself. I will
keep the law given by God, sanctioned by man. I
will hold by the principles received by me when I
was sane, and not mad, as I am now. Laws and
principles are not for the times when there is no
temptation. They are for such moments as this,
when body and soul rise in mutiny against their rigor.
Stringent are they? Inviolate they shall be. If, at
my individual convenience, I might break them, what
would be their worth? They have a worth, so I have
always believed; and, if I cannot believe it now, it is
because I am insane, with my veins running fire,
and my heart beating faster than I can count. Pre-conceived
opinions, foregone determinations, are all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
I have at this hour to stand by. <em>There</em> I plant my
foot!"</p>

<p>Other women have been brave and pure, but this
woman was an Abdiel. Never had she faltered in her
life, never encountered a sham but to crush it. We
did not know what freedom meant, till we had this
book. Its advent was an era, not merely in the literature,
but in the life, of woman. Its welcome, so
profound, so stirring, betrayed the secrets of womanly
nature. Do you remember how you sat and discussed
this book, far into the night?&mdash;how you
wondered whether man or woman wrote it?&mdash;how
the women it enfranchised <em>looked</em> their scorn when
you suggested the first possibility?&mdash;how your temper
and feeling, and sense of justice, were roused by it?
All this was because a life resolute and free poured
itself out between those covers. A woman delicate,
cleanly, quaint, secured the polished purity of every
page. Will you start, if I ask you who ever stated
the Woman's-Rights' argument with the serene force
of the little lace-mender in the "Professor"? Do you
not envy her and her husband the happy English
home secured by their united labors? Ah! when
she gave us later that exquisite miniature of her
sister Emily which she called "Shirley," that noble
bit of Rubens color which she named "Villette," the
same flood of womanly thought and feeling poured
through the prayer,&mdash;<em>the same flood</em>, though we no
longer started as when we first heard society's signal
gun, and saw her whole fleet hoist the flag of distress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Women ought to buy that old stone house
upon the hillside, set in among the tombs, and framed
in purple heather. The lives which began and ended
there have hedged it in with laurels. Read this life
and these works, and learn what fortunes hang upon
a noble living. Read them, that you may learn how
to cheer the world with what is natural and dignified,
to do your Master's work, regardless of narrow criticism
or still disdain. The host of imitators who
stand about Charlotte Bronté's still-open grave are the
best tribute to the power that went out from her,&mdash;a
power tempered by the sweetest personal graces, by
a housekeeping delicate and pure and tasteful, which
never lets us dream of Jane in her school at Morton,
of Shirley in her peach-room parlor, of the lace-mender
at the professor's desk, or Lucy Snowe in the
first class of Paul Emanuel, as otherwise than brilliant
in cleanliness and order. I turn reluctantly from
a life so well known, and now, thank God, beginning
to be so well understood.</p>

<p>I do not treat of Margaret Fuller as a literary
power; for, whatever may be her rank in this respect,
she does not exert a tithe of the influence in this way,
which attaches to the idea of her as a person, to <em>herself</em>
as the centre of the radiant and shining group of
women who were known as "Margaret's friends."</p>

<p>Her "Woman in the Nineteenth Century" is a
scholarly, refined, and noble plea for the freedom of
her sex. In point of ability, no book can be named
with it, if we except that of Madame d'Héricourt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
It has an advantage over that of Mary Wollstonecraft,
in being, so far as the author could make it, a
<em>complete</em> statement; but it is written so much more
from the stand-point of thought and feeling, that it
has had a far more limited influence. There is not a
word in the "Vindication" which the most simple
might not read as he ran, and, reading, understand;
but much of the "Nineteenth Century" depends
upon a critical scholarship, and an evasive delicacy
of sentiment and thought, which elude the common
grasp. Precious passages have become axioms. "Let
her be a sea-captain, if she will," has a power in both
hemispheres; for it has been justified to learned and
simple, by Captain Betsy, of the Scotch schooner,
"Cleotus," and the sweet and noble woman who so
lately carried an American ship round Cape Horn.
The life of Margaret Fuller is in everybody's hands;
but not even Boston <em>women</em> appreciate her personal
influence. Who <em>else</em> could be expected to understand
it? Her very existence was a stimulus to endeavor;
and hundreds of women become practical "Exaltadas,"
because they saw the position she was permitted
to hold. "I always know a Boston woman," said a
rough German miner to me, beyond Lake Huron:
"she always has Margaret Fuller's stamp upon her;"
and I felt that his words were true. We have missed
her sadly since she was taken from us. Ever memorable
will be the "Life and Writings," which revive
our memories better than they satisfy our demands.
"It will be seen," she once wrote, "that my youth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
was not unfriended, since those great minds came to
me in kindness." We have not been unfriended
either, since she was permitted to come to us. If I
were to characterize her in two words, it would be
as "Truth-teller and Truth-compeller." She not only
spoke what she thought, in her own way, let it be
abrupt or gentle, but she compelled us to do the
same. There was something in her presence which
tore away all disguises: even unconscious pretension
could not bear it. We were soon made to feel
whether we had any right to our own thoughts.
"What I especially admired in her," says Dr. Hedge,
"was her intellectual sincerity. Her judgments took
no bribe from her sex or sphere, nor from custom nor
tradition nor caprice. She valued truth supremely,
both for herself and others. The question with her
was, not what <em>should</em> be believed, nor what <em>ought</em> to be
true, but what is true. Her 'yes' and 'no' were
never conventional; and she often amazed people by
a cool and unsuspected dissent from the commonplaces
of popular acceptation."</p>

<p>"Truth-teller and Truth-compeller,"&mdash;the words
seem to fall like the shadow of Omnipotence, a noble
fillet for a woman's forehead. What a noble <em>character</em>
that must have been, which inspired the remark
made after her marriage:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Her life, since she went abroad, is wholly unknown
to me; but I have an unshaken trust, that
what Margaret did she can defend." An "unshaken
trust,"&mdash;such words are a challenge to all noble living.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
In great and small matters, we are told, she
was a woman of her word, and so gave those who
conversed with her the unspeakable comfort which
flows from plaindealing. "I walk over burning
ploughshares, and they sear my feet, yet nothing but
truth will do," she says; and again, in a letter to a
friend: "My own entire sincerity in every passage of
life gives me a right to expect that I shall be met by
no unmeaning phrases or attentions."</p>

<p>I enlarge upon this trait of character, for I think it
Margaret's due. Everybody here knows her reputation
as a scholar: few know her character as a
woman. In beautiful keeping with this trait was her
letter to Miss Martineau, after the publication of her
book upon this country.</p>

<p>"When Jouffroy writes his lectures," she says, "I
am not conversant with all his topics; but I can
appreciate his lucid style and admirable method.
When Webster speaks on the currency, I do not understand
the subject; but I do understand his mode
of treating it, and can see what a blaze of light flows
from his torch. When Harriet Martineau writes
about America, I often cannot test that rashness and
inaccuracy of which I hear so much; but I can feel
that they exist. A want of soundness and patient
investigation is found throughout the book; and I
cannot be happy in it, because it is not worthy of
my friend.</p>

<p>"I have thought it right to say all this to you, since
I feel it. I have shrunk from the effort, for I fear that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
I must lose you. If your heart turn from me, I shall
still love you; and I could no more have been happy
in your friendship, if I had not spoken out."</p>

<p>What a noble pattern in that letter for us all!
The electric power of her womanhood, which claimed
the inmost being of every one with whom she came
in contact, I can best express in the words of Emerson:&mdash;</p>

<p>"She had found out her own secret by early comparison,
and knew what power to draw confidence,
what necessity to lead in every circle, belonged of
right to her. She had drawn to her every superior
young man or woman she had ever met; and whole
romances of life and love had been confided, counselled,
thought, and lived through, in her cognizance
and sympathy. She extorted the secret of life which
cannot be told without setting heart and mind in
a glow, and thus she had the best of those she saw.
She lived in a superior circle; for people suppressed
all their commonplaces in her presence. Her mood
applied itself to the mood of her companion, point
to point, in the most limber, sinuous, vital way, and
drew out the most extraordinary narratives."</p>

<p>When we remember this wealth of sympathy and
appreciation, is it not sad to hear her say, no one
ever gave such invitation to her mind as to tempt
her to a full confession?&mdash;that she felt a power to
enrich her thought with such wealth and variety of
embellishment as would no doubt be tedious to such
as she conversed with?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>A bitter reproach to us women, certainly. What
better <em>could</em> we do than listen, while she embellished
her thought with all wealth and variety possible?
And I quote the saying, because hers are not the only
noble lips which have a right to repeat it. Could
we but be patient listeners! In that way, we might
educate powers of expression, and become possessed
of wealth of which we have very little idea. What
does such a saying record,&mdash;her egotism or our selfishness,
her insatiable demand or our bankruptcy?
We may well confess to mortification when we read;
but it is not felt for <em>her</em>. Very beautiful is the conception
of this Memoir of Margaret, this triune testimony
of independent minds. We should be more
grateful for the analytical skill shown in Emerson's
contribution, did it not bear witness to <em>power</em>, rather
than <em>appreciation</em>. We see, though he could not,
what Margaret missed in her friend. She could
not exempt the finest thinker she knew from the
customary tribute; but he could not pay her in current
coin,&mdash;only in some native ore, which it cost her
much to make available at need. Some time may
<em>women</em> write the lives of women! Why not warm
thy scalpel, O philosopher! out of regard to what
was once tender, quivering, human flesh? Rumor
and prejudice carried the news of Margaret's faults
far enough while she was living: what we need now
is to send on the same wave the most abundant
and satisfying proof of her goodness and genius.
When great men speak of her, they should speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
grandly, and find for what vulgar natures <em>must</em> misconceive,
the noble and generous interpretation. I
do not mean that <span class="smcap">SHE</span> would have shrunk from the
boldest statement of the truth. It was in her to
invite it. "She could say," says Emerson, "as if she
were stating a scientific fact, in enumerating the
merits of somebody, <em>he appreciates me</em>;" and he refers
this saying to the "mountainous <em>me</em>" of hereditary
organization, italicizing the offending monosyllable.
But, in Margaret's mind, the emphasis lay quite as
often on the word <em>appreciates</em>; and the statement
was of a psychological fact, a superiority to vulgar
prejudice, which laid some claim to her generous
estimate in return. Ah! when those we love are
gone for ever, their faults drop away, like the garment,
which was of the earth, earthy; but to great
and noble words, to heroic and womanly living,
God has given a power of blessing far beyond the
grave. We lost her at a moment when we could
ill bear it,&mdash;when, instructed by the noble sympathies
of Mazzini, softened by her own sweet and tender
ministrations in Italian hospitals, revealed at length
in loving beauty by a wife's and mother's experience,
she might have come home the woman she
had often made us dream of. We see the shadow
of it all in that little picture which once hung on the
walls of the Boston Athenæum; and, God willing,
we shall yet encounter the glad reality beyond the
reach of tempests, beyond the need of wreck, lifted
into true deserving of so great a privilege on the
broad ocean of an Infinite Love!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Florence Nightingale is no exception in the history
of her sex, only a consummate flower of its
daily bloom. Ever since the commencement of the
Christian era, whole armies of women have devoted
themselves, not for a few years only, like Florence
Nightingale, but for their whole lives long, to the
same painful duties,&mdash;women who organized their
bands with an efficiency and thoroughness, felt to
this very day, and which made them the competent
instructors of Florence Nightingale in the Crimea.
The holiest vocation fails to instruct the unprepared
mind. The soil of the nineteenth century is fallow;
but in the year 385 a saintly woman traversed those
same Crimean shores. Of her it was written:&mdash;</p>

<p>"She was marvellous debonaire and piteous to
them that were sicke and comforted them, and served
them right humbly, and gave them largely to eat, such
as they asked; but to herself she was hard in her
sickness and scarce, for she refused to eat flesh, how
well she gave it to others, and also to drink wine. She
was oft by them that were sicke, and she laid the pillows
aright and in point, and she rubbed their feet,
and boiled water to wash them; and it seemed to her
that the less she did to the sicke in service, so much
the less service did she to God, and deserved the less
mercy; therefore she was to them piteous, and nothing
to herself."</p>

<p>The Church canonized this woman, who carried
her own substance to the work in which the British
Government sustained Florence Nightingale so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
centuries later; but the public mind was not prepared,
so the world has never rung to the name of Santa
Paula.</p>

<p>Florence Nightingale's most heroic service lay in
breaking open the storehouses at Scutari. It may
have cost her very little, but at that moment the force
of accumulated character made itself felt. An everlasting
reproach to all cowards of circumlocution
offices, the duty not a single commissioned officer had
courage to assume has gently crowned the woman
with the woven suffrages of the world.</p>

<p>The name of Mary Patton has with us also a true
educational power. There was no obstacle nor vulgar
prejudice which this heroic girl was not called to
combat. Not twenty years old, with two little children
clinging to her skirts, and the great primal
sorrow of her sex overshadowing her afresh, with
her husband bereft of reason, and neither nurse nor
physician at hand, she kept the ship's reckoning,
overpowered a mutinous mate, and carried her vessel
triumphantly in to the destined port.</p>

<p>The author of "John Halifax" has so laid us under
obligation by work faithfully done, that it seems worth
while to indicate the inconsistencies which warp her
"Thoughts about Women."</p>

<p>She speaks of the "Woman's-Rights movement"
in this country, as if it were a movement to <em>force</em>
women into a certain position, instead of an effort
to set them <em>free</em>, to the end that they may ascertain
whether they have any capacity for it. She sneers at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
letters and account-books kept by women; and we
read her words in a country where women are widely
and creditably established as book-keepers, and where
they hold classes to instruct others in accounts! She
tells us that more than one-half of English women
are obliged to provide for themselves; and gives a
noble example of two young women, who, on their
father's death, continued to carry on a disagreeable
business, to keep books, manage stock, and control
agents. They sustained a delicate mother in ease,
and never once compromised their womanhood.
What became of the womanly unfitness for letters
and accounts in that case? She speaks of the contemptible
and unwomanly habit of beating down,
and says that men are less prone to it than women.
Who keeps the purse-strings of a family? Who
condemn women to the practical ignorance which
makes them too uncertain of values to turn at once
from a manifest overcharge?</p>

<p>But, sadder still, this woman brings against her
sex the two grave charges of common falsehood and
disloyalty in friendship. We may pity her for a
social experience which seems to her to justify the
statement; but let us never repeat the libel. Let Margaret
Fuller answer it, not only by a life of radiant
truth, but by the words in which she speaks of the
honor of which young hearts are capable, and the
secret of her own young life voluntarily kept by
forty girls.</p>

<p>In her chapter on "Lost Women," Miss Muloch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
does grateful service when she draws attention to
those who choose to dwell in the very gutters of idle
gossip and filthy scandal, who soil their lips and
tongues while they take selfishly faithful care of their
reputations. This word needed to be spoken. Better
for a woman, that she should be a cast-away in a
city refuge, with a mind comparatively pure, than
a woman in high society, capable of catching or uttering
the vile "double entendre," always on the lookout
for a possible vulgarism, wringing decency out
of human life as if it were only a wet napkin, and
sceptical of the purity and innocence she has not yet
found in her own heart.</p>

<p>In estimating the influences which modify public
opinion concerning women, I am not willing to be
silent concerning the popular idea of love. It is a
common thing to hear it said, with a sort of sneer,
that no <em>man</em> ever died for love,&mdash;as if it were a quite
romantic and in nowise <em>dis</em>creditable thing that many
women should!</p>

<p>Creditable and discreditable elements may enter
into the assumed fact as it regards man; but if he
does not die for love because he more thoroughly
acknowledges his responsibility, keeping God in his
right place <em>above</em>, and his own heart and its idols in
their right place <em>below</em>, then we may drop the unwomanly
sneer, and go and do likewise.</p>

<p>I shall have little hope for woman, till <em>she</em> learns to
feel that to die for love is not so much a pitiful as a
disgraceful thing; that it proves of itself that God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
was never to her what he should have been; that life
had no aim so holy as the weak indulgence of a sentiment
or a passion, or some generous longing for
some duty God did not set before her; that all the
world's work and society's ambition was hidden from
her by a desire for personal happiness, spread like a
film over her moral vision.</p>

<p>No better education do I claim for woman than
her entire <em>self-possession</em>, the ultimate endowment
of all the promise she carries in her nature. "The
great law of culture," says Carlyle, "is, Let each become
all that he was created capable of being; expand,
if possible, to his full growth; and show himself in his
own shape and stature, be they what they may."&mdash;"The
excellent woman," writes the Hindoo in Calcutta,
"is she who, if the father dies, can be father
and provider to the household."</p>

<p>"Who," says Count Zinzendorf in Germany,&mdash;"who
but my wife could have been alternately servant
and mistress without affectation and without pride?
Who could have maintained like her, in a democratic
community, all outward and inward distinctions?
Who, without a murmur, would have met such peril?
Who could have raised such sums of money, and
acquitted them on her own credit?"</p>

<p>To such women I think men will always offer generous
help; and, even if they did not, there are props
of God's own disposing. Let woman once reject the
absurd notion that she was created for happiness, let
her constitute herself instead a creator of it, let her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
accept with joy the fact that this is a working-day
world; then she will no longer strive to escape from
labor, discipline, or sorrow, but will gladly hail each
in its turn as part of God's appointed teaching, a
shadow crossing the sunshine to show that it is bright.
Perhaps such a life is not easy, perhaps many feet
must falter on such a path; but, indicating what I
earnestly believe to be the will and way of God for
us all, I earnestly entreat you to enter and walk
therein. Some words written by John Ruskin upon
Art seem to me to have such force in this connection
as to make it justifiable to quote them.</p>

<p>Speaking of a painter who could only paint the
fair and graceful in landscape, he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But such work had, nevertheless, its stern limitations,
and marks of everlasting inferiority. Always
soothing and pathetic, it could never be sublime, never
freely nor entrancingly beautiful; for the man's narrow
spirit could not cast itself freely into any scene. The
calm cheerfulness which shrank from the shadow of
the cypress and the distortion of the olive, could not
enter into the brightness of the sky they pierced, nor
the softness of the bloom they bore. For every sorrow
that his heart turned from, he lost a consolation.
For every fear which he dared not confront, he parted
with a portion of his manliness. The unsceptred
sweep of the storm-clouds, the fair freedom of glancing
shower and flickering sunbeam, sunk into sweet rectitudes
and decent formalisms; and, before eyes that
refused to be dazzled or darkened, the hours of sunset<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
wreathed their rays unheeded, and the mists of the
Apennines spread their blue veils in vain."</p>

<p>Imagine these words written metaphorically of your
own inner lives, and accept the lesson they convey.
Be earnest to inherit the whole of human life. Insist
on turning the golden shield, till you have, not merely
the iron lining full in view, but whatsoever Medusa's
head the Divine hand has traced thereon.</p>

<p>See how many women have excelled in literature
and art, in philosophy and science, within the present
century. Their literary contributions owe their popularity
to intrinsic excellence: they have sought and
found the light of day, without the pompous recommendations
of institutions, or the forced encouragement
of a clique. There is no limit to womanly
attainment, other than the force of womanly desire.
Bihéron, destined to become an anatomist, becomes
one, whether the college of dissectors smile or frown.
Wittembach, versed alike in the mysteries of ancient
tongues and modern physics, becomes the counsellor
of the wisest men of her time, without neglecting her
pantry or her needle. There is no excuse for neglecting
any home duty for the most desirable foreign pursuit.
Let buttons and shirt-bosoms have their day, the
lexicon or grammar its own also. Let the dinner-table
be carefully spread; the food, not only well cooked, but
gracefully laid,&mdash;before we seek the more precious
nutriment of culture: and this, not so much because
any one has a right to say it <em>shall</em> be so, as out of our
own tender regard to the needs of others, and a desire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
through every possible self-sacrifice, to make the common
road easier, and turn recreant public opinion to its
proper vent. Let a neatness as exquisite, as womanly
and as polished as that of Charlotte Bronté, pervade
not only our homes, but consecrate our own personal
appearance; then may we safely wear the livery of
schools. It may be double-dyed in indigo; yet, with
this accessory, no man will assert that it is unbecoming,
no woman have need to comfort her own ignorance
by an unsisterly sneer.</p>

<p>If God intends woman to walk side by side with
man wherever he sees fit to go, the movement now
beginning must materially develop civilization. Finer
elements will be poured into the molten metal of
society; and, when the next cast is taken, we shall see
sharper edges, bolder reliefs, and a finer lining, than
we have been wont. Nor shall we miss the gentler
graces. The classical world bitterly mourned the
young and gifted lecturer, Olympia Morata; but not
with the broken-hearted agony of the husband whose
strength and life she had always been. Clotilda
Tambroni was crowned, not only with the laurels of
a Greek professorship, but with modesty and every
virtue.</p>

<p>It was the tender appreciation of the WOMEN of
Bologna that erected a stately monument to Laura
Veratti.</p>

<p>In England, a woman writes admirable tales to
endow a bishopric in a distant land. In our country,
it was a pleasant omen, that the woman who first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
made literature a profession was urged to it, neither
by scholarly taste nor an eccentric ambition, but to
fulfil a mother's duty to four orphan children. Her
literary career is not yet closed; and, though not lofty
in its range, has been steadily pursued, and deserves
the regard which it has won.</p>

<p>The names of Sedgwick, Sigourney, Kirkland, and
Child suggest womanly excellences first of all. Let
us pay the debt we owe these women, by following
hopefully in the paths they have opened, till we create
a public opinion without reproach.</p>

<p class="center"><strong>DEATH OR DISHONOR.</strong></p>


<blockquote><p>"How high, beneficent, sternly inexorable, if forgotten, is the duty laid, not
on women only, but on every creature, in regard to these particulars!"&mdash;<span class="smcap">T. Carlyle.</span></p></blockquote>

<p class="dropcap">THE delicate ladies on Beacon Street, who order
their ices and creams flavored with vanilla or
pear-juice, may not know that bituminous coal, rope-ends,
and creosote, furnish a larger proportion of the
piquant seasoning than the blossoming bean or the
orchard-tree; but every man of science does.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Already the chemist furnishes the attar of Cashmere
from heaps of offal that lie rotting by the way.
It is as if God forced man face to face with every
repellent fact of nature, and said, "Slake thy thirst
at this turbid fountain, child of the dust; or the
purer streams of the hillside shall trickle for thee in
vain."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Somewhat so, I am compelled to turn your eyes to
the most repulsive side of human life. I do not do it
willingly, but of a necessity; not because I like it,
but because it is essential to the argument. May the
contact prove, that the perfumed joy of later years
has disguised itself, for both of us, in the rotting accumulations
of our social life!</p>

<p>It rests with yourselves to decide. These lectures
may be useless; they may fill your minds with painful
details, open hideous vistas, and blind you to the
tempting, heavenward ways which we love to see the
young and beautiful pursue.</p>

<p>But, in such case, the responsibility is not mine.
<em>I</em> would have you look on vice, that you may learn
to loathe it; <em>I</em> would have you realize, that what a
noble friend of ours has called the "perishing classes"
are made of men and women like yourselves.</p>

<p>Bidding you trust, to a certain extent, to the truth
of those terrible statistics that crush Thomas Henry
Buckle in their grasp, I would still have you remember,
that, beside the active laws of moral and material
life, there is ever the living God immanent in the
world; and that it is always for <em>you</em> to change the results
of history, at any given era, according to the
great first law,&mdash;none the less real because so often
forgotten,&mdash;that this living God helps or hinders you
as you will, and becomes, at any moment that you
choose, an important element in each calculation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>The subject at present before us is "Woman's
Claims to Labor."</p>

<p>These claims rest upon three points:&mdash;</p>

<p>First, The absolute necessity of bread.</p>

<p>Second, A natural ability, physical and psychical;
and an attraction inherent in the ability.</p>

<p>Third, An absolute want of the moral nature.</p>

<p>Having treated these in turn, I propose to show
you what practical opposition man offers to her advance;
what fault lies in herself; how much more
numerous are the occupations open than is generally
supposed; and what social obstructions have prevented
her taking advantage of them.</p>

<p>In this connection, I shall speak of those women
who have opened a way for their sex; and shall offer
to you certain plans of action, by which, it seems to
me, the convenience and the happiness of the employer
and the employed may be materially advanced,
especially as regards our own city. Like a wise child,
who from his fretful pillow takes the pill first, and the
conserve afterwards, I shall open the most painful
branch of my subject in this lecture, and turn from
it as soon as the needed impression has been made.</p>

<p>I ask for woman, then, free, untrammelled access to
all fields of labor; and I ask it, first, on the ground
that she needs to be fed, and that the question which
is at this moment before the great body of working
women is "death or dishonor:" for lust is a better
paymaster than the mill-owner or the tailor, and economy
never yet shook hands with crime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Do you object, that America is free from this alternative?
I will prove you the contrary within a rod
of your own doorstep.</p>

<p>Do you assert, that, if all avenues were thrown
open, it would not increase the quantity of work; and
that there would be more laborers in consequence,
and lower wages for all?</p>

<p>Lower wages for <em>some</em>, I reply; but certainly higher
wages for women; and they, too, would be raised to
the rank of partners, and personal ill treatment would
not follow those who had position and property before
the law.</p>

<p>You offer them a high education in vain till you
add to it the stimulus of a free career. In this lecture,
I undertake to prove to you, that a large majority of
women stand in such relations to their employers,
that they are compelled to death or a life of shame.
Why not choose death, then?</p>

<p>So I asked once of a woman thus pressed to the
wall. "Ah, madam!" she answered, "I chose it long
ago for myself; but what shall I do for my mother
and child?"</p>

<p>The superior has a right to every advantage which
he can honestly gain, as well as the inferior; but he
has no right to increase any natural difference in his
favor, if he believe it to exist, by laws or customs
which cripple the inferior. If, as political economists
tell us, it is chiefly by man, collectively taken, that the
property of society is created; and if, on that very
ground, man's interest has the first claim to consideration,&mdash;does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
it not follow, that every friend of woman
will try to induce her to become a capitalist, and open
to her, as her first path to safety, the way to honorable
independence? And, in this connection, I must repeat
what some of you have often heard me say, that
a want of respect for labor, and a want of respect for
woman, lies at the bottom of all our difficulties, low
wages included.</p>

<p>I will not admit that the argument of the political
economist has, as yet, any rightful connection with
the price of woman's work. "The price of labor will
always rise or fall," he says, "as the number of laborers
is small or large; and it is because there are too
many women for a few avenues of labor that the
wages are so low." If man believes this, let him help
us to open new avenues, and so reduce the number in
any one. But I claim that he has increased the
natural difference in his own favor, supposing that
there be any such, by laws and customs which cripple
woman; and that his own lust of gain stands in the
way of her daily bread. Just so in hydraulics, men
tell us, that water rises everywhere to the level of its
source; but you may raise it a thousand feet higher
by the aid of your forcing-pump, or drop it from a
siphon a thousand feet below. And a forcing-pump
and a siphon has man imposed upon the natural currents
of labor. If, in my correspondence with employers
last winter, one man told me with pride that
he gave from eight to fifty cents for the making of
pantaloons, including the heaviest doeskins, he <em>forgot</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
to tell me what he charged his customers for the same
work. Ah! on those bills, so long unpaid, the eight
cents sometimes rises to thirty, and the fifty cents
<em>always</em> to a dollar or a dollar and twenty-five cents.</p>

<p>The most efficient help this class of workwomen
could receive would be the thorough adoption of the
cash system, and the establishment of a large workshop
in the <em>hands of women</em> consenting to moderate
profits, and superintended by those whose position in
society would win respect for labor. When I said, six
months ago, that ten Beacon-street women, engaged
in honorable work, would do more for this cause
than all the female artists, all the speech-making and
conventions, in the world, I was entirely in earnest.</p>

<p>It is pretty and lady-like, men think, to paint and
chisel: philanthropic young ladies must work for
nothing, like the angels. <em>Let</em> them, when they rise to
angelic spheres; but, here and now, every woman who
works for nothing helps to keep her sister's wages
down,&mdash;helps to keep the question of death or dishonor
perpetually before the women of the slop-shop.</p>

<p>Why? Because she helps to depress the estimate
of woman's ability. What is persistently given for
nothing is everywhere thought to be worth nothing.
I throw open a door here for some stifled sufferer at
the West End: let her open a clothing establishment,
and employ her own sex; let her make money by it,
and watch for the end. When an Employment Society
or a Needle-woman's Friend becomes bankrupt in
purse, it is bankrupt in morals and argument as well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
The wheels of the world move on the grooves of good
management, of success. Set these once firmly underneath,
and the outcry against our moral Fultons
will be hushed.</p>

<p>In country villages and farming districts, there is
a great deal of harmful competition with the girls of
the slop-shops, which can never be ended until it is
considered respectable for women openly to earn
money. The stitching of wallets, hat-linings, and
shoe-bindings, the more delicate labor on linen collars
and shirt-bosoms, is carried on now not merely by so-called
benevolent societies who want to build churches,
lecture-rooms, and so on, but by rich farmers' wives,
who keep or do not keep servants, in the long, summer
afternoons and winter evenings, because it is work
that can be done privately, and is sought to supply
them with jewelry and dress. If they will not educate
their minds by profitable reading, it is earnestly to be
desired they should work, but openly, for money, and
at such trades as naturally fall to their lot. Herb
and fruit drying, distilling, preserving, pickling, market-gardening,
may yet lay the foundations of ample fortune
for many a woman. I have passed a summer
amid lovely landscapes, where the women found
neither fruit <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'not'">nor</ins> vegetables for their table, but let the
brown earth plead to them in vain; while they stitched,
stitched, stitched the long hours away, every broken
needle bearing witness against the broken lives of
women who needed in distant cities, where they stood
homeless and starving, the work their sisters pilfered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
sitting at their ease beside the hearth-stone.
Their ignorance was their excuse. Let it not be ours.</p>

<p>And, first, for a few general statements.</p>

<p>An indispensable requisite for what the Germans
call a "bread study" is, that, for average talent, it
should command moderate success. "Of all causes
of prostitution in Paris," says Duchâtelet, "and probably
in all great towns, none is so active as the want
of work, or inadequate remuneration. What are the
earnings of our laundresses, seamstresses, and milliners?
Compare the price of labor with the price of
dishonor, and you will cease to be surprised that women
fall. Out of 5,183 prostitutes in Paris, I found
that 2,696 had been driven to the streets by starvation;
and 89, to feed starving parents or children.
That is 300 over one-half of the whole number."</p>

<p>"It is well known," writes Miss Craig, in Edinburgh,
"how brief is the career that our female criminals
run. How they are recruited, it is not hard to
guess in a country where there are fifty thousand
women working for less than sixpence a day, and a
hundred thousand for less than one shilling."</p>

<p>When, a few years ago, the "Edinburgh Review"
collected the statistics of female labor, it found the
wages about half what were paid to men. But no
reason was assigned for this difference; only, one
master gardener ventured to assert, that women ate
less than men!</p>

<p>An advertisement in London for fifty dressmakers
brought seven hundred applicants to the door of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
warehouse; and, after long waiting, a police-officer
brought the employer to explain why they could not
all be hired. Sir James Clarke tells us, that the results
of the inquiry into the condition of this class of
women exceeded in horror those of the factory commission.
Eighteen hours a day was the allotted time
for work; and nothing but strong coffee enabled them
to ply their needles. Fifteen hundred employers keep
fifteen thousand girls. In driving times, they work all
night. One girl testified that she had worked through
the whole Sunday fifteen times in two years.</p>

<p>The lace-makers also work from twelve to twenty
hours; and, in families where a peculiar "knack" is
thought to be transmitted, children are put to this
work from the age of two years. There is no regular
time for food or sleep in certain stages of the manufacture;
and many of these overworked women become
vagrants.</p>

<p>A terrible letter from a Manchester mantle-maker
was lately published, in which she pleads to be permitted
to earn twopence an hour, when compelled to
work overtime (that is, over twelve hours a day); and
says, pitifully, that, if the present regulations go on,
nothing but death can save her from dishonor.</p>

<p>A Persian traveller, who visited the bazaar in Soho,
was greatly shocked when he found that all those
young women were earning their own living; and
plumed himself on the superior happiness of the
women of his own country. What would he have
said, could he have followed the clergyman's daughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
as we must do, from a happy home and fine sewing,
down, through all the degradations of the slop-shop,
to the very gutter?</p>

<p>But this is England.</p>

<p>Out of two thousand women who work for their
daily bread in New York, five hundred and thirty-four
receive a dollar a week. "How many men," asks Dr.
Chapin, "would keep off death and conquer the Devil
on such wages? One woman had to do it by making
caps at two cents each! Think of this, women who
like to buy things cheap: for, if the veil could be lifted
from your eyes, <em>you</em> would see&mdash;the angels <em>do</em> see&mdash;on
your gay, white dresses many a crimson stain; and
among the dewy flowers with which you wreathe
your hair, the grass that grows on graves!"</p>

<p>Seven thousand eight hundred and fifty ruined
women walk the streets of New York,&mdash;five hundred
ordinary omnibus-loads. They are chiefly young
women under twenty, and the average length of
the lives they lead is just four years. Every four
years, then, seven thousand eight hundred and fifty
women are drawn from their homes, many of them
from simple, rural hearths, to meet this fate. What
drives them to it? The want of bread.</p>

<p>Last October, two vagrant women came before a
Liverpool court, who testified that they had been
driven to evil courses by blows, and forced to support
in idleness, by their vice, the father of one, and
the husband of the other.</p>

<p>This statement shocks you: but poor pay strikes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
as heavy a blow as a husband's right arm; and these
seven thousand eight hundred and fifty women in
New York supported hundreds of men in ease, before
they dropped from the seamstress's chair to the curbstone
and the gutter.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Tait says that the permanent prostitution of any
city bears a recognized numerical relation to its
means of occupation. You ask for proof.</p>

<p>Out of two thousand cases in the city of New
York, five hundred and twenty-five pleaded destitution
as the cause.</p>

<p>One of the police-officers testified of one girl,
"She struggled hard before she fell; living on bread
and water, and sleeping in station-houses. In three
years, I have known more than fifty such cases."</p>

<p>A young girl of seventeen was left with the care
of a sick, crippled sister. They were left to touch the
very brink of despair. A kindly, fair-faced woman
brought work which saved them from death. More
was promised, on conditions that you can guess;
and the toils so skilfully woven, that the young and
healthy longed for her sister's sickly face and broken
limb to ward off her fate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"When a whole day's work brings only a few
pennies," said another to Dr. Sanger, "a smile will
buy me a dinner."</p>

<p>Out of these two thousand women, one thousand
eight hundred and eighty had been brought up "<em>to
do nothing</em>:" but, of all the trades, dressmaking
furnished the largest proportion; and yet you think
you pay your dressmakers well!</p>

<p>Out of the two thousand, all but fifty-one had
been religiously educated.</p>

<p>"It has been shown elsewhere," says Dr. Sanger,
"that the public are responsible for this evil, because
they persist in excluding women from many kinds
of employment for which they are fitted, while for
work that is open they receive inadequate compensation.
The community are equally responsible for
non-interference with openly acknowledged evils."</p>

<p>Thus far I have spoken of New York. I might
speak to you of Philadelphia and Boston, and tell you
of ruin wrought under my own eyes; of the daughter
of a State-street merchant found in the gutters of Toronto
years ago; of a daughter whom that wealthy
father dared not deny, when I wrote to him, though he
refused to furnish the bread that would have kept her
from sin. I know how hard it is for a true and good
man to open his eyes to the wickedness and misery
near at hand. I have no desire to draw down upon
myself the local wrath of small clothiers and petty
officials. You know what wages are in England:
let us go thither for our concluding facts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>There are five hundred thousand single women
in England, and one out of every thirteen is a thing
of shame; that is, there are thirty-eight thousand
four hundred and sixty-one women of the town.</p>

<p>Almost none of these women are drawn from domestic
service. Many were found in New York
who had lived out for twenty-five cents a week, and
from that dropped to moral death.</p>

<p>You know what to expect from the lot of English
dressmakers, mantlemakers, and laceweavers;
but does it not chill you with horror to think that
the class of governesses and private teachers furnishes
also a certain number?</p>

<p>There is in London a Governesses' Benevolent
Institution. There were lately before its committee
a hundred and twenty candidates for annuities of a
hundred dollars a year. Ninety-nine were unmarried,
eighty-three were literally penniless, all of them were
over fifty years of age, and forty-nine of them
were over sixty.</p>

<p>One woman had labored for twenty-six years,
supporting a mother and five brothers and sisters,
all of whom she had educated at her own expense;
but she had not saved a penny. Three were ruined
by attempting to sustain their fathers in business.
Six had invalid sisters dependent upon them. These
are the histories of pure, untarnished names: fancy
for yourselves the tales told by dishonored lips. The
labors of Mr. Mayhew among this forsaken class of
women are probably familiar by name to you all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
To deepen the impression which I wish to make, I
shall quote some of the evidence offered by him in
his letters to the "Morning Chronicle," and close this
branch of my subject. Eleven thousand women under
twenty are employed in the slop-shops. If their own
words do not touch you, mine, of course, will fail.</p>

<p><em>1st Case.</em>&mdash;"I work from six, <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, to ten, <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> In
the best weeks, I clear a dollar and fifty cents; but I
only average seventy-five cents the year round. My
mother is sixty-seven, and seldom gets a day's work.
She scours pots for the publicans at thirty-seven cents
a day, but is otherwise dependent upon me. I was a
good girl when I first went to work, and struggled
hard to keep pure; but I had not enough to eat.
Then I took up with a young man, turned of twenty,
who said he would make me his lawful wife; but I
<em>hardly cared, so I could feed myself and mother</em>.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Many young girls tempted me,&mdash;they were so happy
with enough to eat and drink. Could I have honestly
earned enough for food and clothes, I would never have
gone wrong; no, never. I fought against it to the
last. If I had been born a lady, it would <em>not have
been hard to act like one</em>."</p>

<p><em>2d Case.</em>&mdash;"I earn seventy-five cents a week clear.
My husband has been dead seven year, and I have
buried three children. I was happy so long as he
lived (here she hid her face in a rusty shawl, and burst
into tears). I was always true to him, so help me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>God! I was an honest woman up to the time my
security<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> died. I swear it. I am glad my children
are dead; for I could not feed them."</p>

<p><em>3d Case.</em>&mdash;"I was an honest woman till my husband
died. I can put my hand on my heart, and
swear it. But I was penniless, and a baby to keep.
The world has drove me about so. When I want
clothes, I <em>must</em> go to the streets."</p>

<p><em>4th Case.</em>&mdash;"I am the daughter of a minister of
the gospel; and I pledge my word solemnly and sacredly,
that it was the low price paid for my labor that
drove me to sin. I could only make thirty-four cents
a week at shirts, and should have starved but for the
street. At last, I swore to myself that I would keep
from it for my boy's sake. I had pawned my clothes,
and slept in a shawl and petticoat under a butcher's
shed. I was trying to get to the workhouse. I had
had no food for two days. My baby's legs froze to my
side, and I sank upon a doorstep. A lady found us,
and would have fed us; but I could not eat. She
rubbed the baby's legs with brandy. That night I
got to the workhouse: but they would not take me in
without an order; so I went back to sin for one
month. It was the last. In my heart I hated it; my
whole nature rebelled at it; and nobody but God
knows how I struggled to give it up. I pawned my
only gown more than once."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Look at the frightful calmness of this story: "They
would not admit me to the workhouse without an
order; <em>so I went back to sin for one month</em>." When
this girl told her story to Mr. Mayhew, she had been
eight years at service, honored by her employers. Her
personal beauty was so great, and the whole story
so romantic, that Mr. Mayhew could hardly believe
that she had come to him of her own accord to save
other women from the same fate; and he took a day's
journey into the country to confirm the facts. Her
employers spoke in high terms of her honesty, sobriety,
industry, and modesty. For her child's sake, she
begged him to conceal her name; and she told her
story with her face hidden in her hands, sobbing so
as scarcely to be understood, and the tears dropping
through.</p>

<p>If you do not realize the commonness of these tragedies,
may God help you! Some of you will assert
that all this is necessary; that, in this age, a certain
proportion of women must meet this fate; and wall
me up with statistics.</p>

<p>I tell you to bring the battering-ram of a Divine
Love to bear on that wall. You will find, then, that,
just as much as it was decreed that such women
should be, it was decreed that an infinite saving power
should exist, and that you should help to make it
available. You may make these statistics what you
will, not in an hour or a day, but in <em>time</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of you will assert that women capable of
falling thus can hardly be worth saving. I know
there is some wilful vice; I do not desire to blink the
truth: but, among those whom ill-paid labor forces
into sin, there are women nobler and more disinterested
than many who remain pure. Look at the
stories I have told you,&mdash;women working for their
kindred; a young girl of seventeen ruined to find
bread for a crippled sister. In New York, the thirty-seven
women supporting infirm parents; twenty-nine
providing for nephews and nieces; twenty-three, widows
with the care of young children.</p>

<p>Those of you who have had personal experience of
these women will not need me to tell you that <em>they</em>
never pay low wages. The washerwomen and starchers
whom they employ are always well paid and well
treated. They give much in charity to save others, as
they often say, from their fate, and doubtless in the
secret hope that God will permit them thus to atone
for their sin. A few years ago, three young girls lived
together in Glasgow. One of them, the youngest and
frailest, a girl whose story was like that of Mrs. Gaskell's
"Ruth," had left a rural home for a dressmaker's
workroom. She fell into a decline, and, in her frequent
delirium, raved about the bleat of her father's
sheep, the evening cow-bell, and the crowing of the
cock. In her lucid moments, the thought that she
must die in shame convulsed her with agony. The
two remaining girls took counsel. "There is no hope
for us," they said; "but perhaps God will forgive us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
if we save her. Let us send her into the country, and
work for her till she dies." And so they did, adding
to the reckless wear of their horrid life the toil of the
needlewoman; but, believe me, they never forgot the
dying smile of her they had saved. Did you or I ever
make a sacrifice which would compare with that? It
is painful for me to stand here, and present this subject;
it is, perhaps, painful for you to listen: but,
with such women among the ruined, only cowards, it
seems to me, would refuse to risk all things to save
them.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>In France, where all women of this class are registered,
Duchâtelet found 1,680 who had erased their
names from the list, on the plea that they had found
honest occupation. He traced them: 108 had become
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'househeepers'">housekeepers</ins>; 864, seamstresses; 247, shopkeepers;
and 461, domestics.</p>

<p>The Society for the Rescue of Young Women, in
London, admitted two hundred members last year.
It asks no questions of those who enter; and the
wisdom of this is shown in the fact, that its subscription-list
contains the names of sixty former inmates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
whose subscriptions range from twenty-five cents to
twenty dollars per annum.</p>

<p>A terrible account has lately been published of the
straw-bonnet warehouses in London, by one who has
worked in them. One single story will show you,
how that <em>touch of truth</em>, which, far more than the
touch of genius, makes the "whole world kin," revealed
a noble human nature in the midst of what
seemed utter depravity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>One day, the worn-out women tried to compel a
young, fresh worker to do less than she was able, or
to secrete a portion of her braid, instead of making it
up. They could not prevail. "Are you a Metherdis,
miss?" asked one woman. "I'm not a thief," she
replied gently. A big, bad woman stole her extra
plait; but no one dared insult her. Once she fainted,
and some one offered her gin; but the big, bad woman
started forward: "Would you make her a devil
like the rest of us?" she cried; "I'd sooner see her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
stabbed!" and she got her a cup of tea from her
own "screw."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> When they were kept late, this woman
walked home with her, cautioning her against
gin, against young men, especially the gentry, and bidding
her not forget her prayers: "for," said she, "<em>you</em>
know how; <em>I</em> was never teached." As she parted from
her one night, she said, "I don't expect it's any use;
but it would do no harm if you prayed <em>once</em> for me."
Who will say that this woman was irreclaimable?
And, in estimating the chances of saving a depraved
woman, you should always remember, that, in nine
cases out of twelve, she sold herself, not to vice, but
to what seemed, at least, to her longing heart, like <em>love</em>.
Put yourself in her place. Do not start: it will do
you no harm. Think what it would be to slave soul
and body, day after day, for a crust and a cup of cold
water. Not so much would your failing body crave
one nourishing meal, as the aching, human heart
within you one tender look, one loving word. If, in
your misery, you had kept some beauty; if you had
known no gentler touch than a drunken father's blow
or a mother's curse,&mdash;how strong would be the
temptation when one above you pleaded for affection!
See how like an angel of light this demon would
descend! O my sisters! you have never read this
story right. Such a woman is no monster, only a
gentle-hearted creature, unsupported by God's law,
unrestrained by self-control. Your scorn, the world's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>rejection, <em>may</em> make her what you think. Meanwhile,
are you above temptation? Does not conscience enforce
my plea?</p>

<p>"Some positions," says Legouvé, "attract by their
ease; but it is work that purifies and fills existence.
God permits hard trials; but he has appointed labor,
and we forget them all." A serious comforter, it gives
always more than it promises, and dries the bitterest
tears. A pleasure unequalled in itself, it is the salt
of all other pleasures.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>You have seen that a necessity to live demands
of you new fields for woman to work in; and the
question arises, Is she fit for these new duties?<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>I consider the question of intellectual ability settled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
The volumes of science, mathematics, general literature,
&amp;c., which women have given to the world,
without sharing to the full the educational advantages
of man, seem to promise that they shall outstrip
him here, the moment they have a fair start.
But I go farther, and state boldly, that women
have, from the beginning, done the hardest and
most unwholesome work of the world in all countries,
whether civilized or uncivilized; and I am prepared
to prove it. I do not mean that rocking the
cradle and making bread is as hard work as any,
but that women have always been doing man's
work, and that all the outcry society makes against
work for women is not to protect <em>women</em>, but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
certain class called <em>ladies</em>. Now, I believe that work
is good for ladies; so let us look at the truth. "Let
it once be understood," says one of our English
friends, "that the young business-woman is shielded
by the social intercourse of those who are called
ladies, and it would obviate many of those grave
objections which deter parents from consenting that
their children shall brave the world in shops and
warehouses."</p>

<p>Most certainly it would; and to this point we
must frequently return. Meanwhile, says Sydney
Smith, "so long as girls and boys run about in the
dirt, and trundle hoop together, they are both precisely
alike;" and I shall proceed to show that large
numbers have not only played but worked in the
dirt together, and trundled hoop, not merely through
our own lives, but ever since work and play began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall speak first of Asiatic women; and I can
afford to begin by quoting a Cochin-China proverb,
to the effect that "a woman has nine lives, and
bears a great deal of killing." I do not know anything
else about the Cochin-China women; but this
looks as if their lot were no exception to the general
rule. The Chinese peasant-woman goes to the
field with her male infant on her back, and ploughs,
sows, and reaps, exposed to all the changes of the
weather. When her husband is proved criminal, she
must die as his accomplice; having, at least, strength
enough to suffer. In Calcutta, women are the masons
who keep the roof tight; and you may see
them daily carrying their hods of cement, spreading
it on the tops of houses, and flattening it with a
wooden rammer like that with which our Irishmen
pave the streets.</p>

<p>You have heard of the Bombay ghauts. Ghaut is
a native word, which means "passage through;" and
it is applied by the resident not only to the railway
cut between the hills, but to the hills themselves.
These are of volcanic origin,&mdash;a sort of trap. Formed
beneath the water, the mass cooled as it was thrown
up, and the sides do not slope much. "When I
gained an elevation of two thousand feet," says my
correspondent, "and looked back, I saw hills of all
shapes and sizes thrown up, and ravines thousands of
feet below, all looking like the dried bed of an ocean.
The table-land on which I stood is two thousand five
hundred feet above the level of the sea; and, as this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the elevation at Poonah, the railroad from Campoolu
winds as it can along the sides of the mountains.
There are twenty-five tunnels through the solid rock
on this road, each half a mile long or more. There
are piers of solid stone, with arches spanning forty
feet, which rise a hundred above the valley. Part of
the grade was formed by lowering men with ropes, to
drill the holes for blasting, a thousand feet above the
ravine. There are twenty thousand workmen employed;
and one-third, or about seven thousand, of
these are"&mdash;what do you think? In a country where
no European man can labor, where the native rests
until compelled by his conqueror to work, in the year
1859 behold seven thousand <em>women</em> laboring in the
ghauts! Climbing, climbing, through the cloudless day,
<em>women</em> carry baskets of stone and earth upon their
heads, to creep to the edge of the ravines, and fill with
these tedious contributions thousands of perpendicular
feet; and the men who pay them, doubtless, talk to their
daughters about <em>woman's</em> lack of physical strength!</p>

<p>In Australia, the woman carries the burdens which
man's indolence refuses; and the deserts of Africa
bear the same testimony in freedom that we glean
from the witness of slavery. In the West-India
Islands, the patient negress toils by the side of her
mate, doing to the full as hard a day's work, though
encumbered by the weight of a child upon her back;
but she does not share, in the same way, his hours of
rest. The customs of Africa still prevail, and she
offers her husband's food and tobacco on her knees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor does the poetry of ancient Greece show us the
so-long vaunted delicacy of the sex. Homer's princesses
beat linen on the rocks, and Andromache shares
all the functions of the groom:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">"For this, high fed in plenteous stalls ye stand,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Served with pure wheat, and by a princess' hand;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For this, my spouse, of great Actæon's line,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So oft hath steeped the strengthening grain in wine!"</span><br />
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We have crossed the boundary line of Europe, without
any change in the indications; and we may drop
from Homer to the middle ages, or modern times, as
well.</p>

<p>The traveller who gazes admiringly upon the vineclad
hills of the Jura, rising, terrace upon terrace, till
the eye can scarce distinguish the limit between the
work of man and the rock of ages which still crowns
the summit, will learn with surprise that the mind
which conceived of such stupendous labor, and the
hand which held out honor and freedom as its reward,
were a woman's.</p>

<p>Under a burning sun, or exposed to a bitter, glacial
<em>bisè</em>, the first cultivators, partly women, climbed slowly
and painfully, by rocky ledges or crevices, along those
dangerous slopes and beetling cliffs, where trees were
to be hewn down and briers plucked up, raising by
manual efforts alone the stone necessary for the steps
and walls, and the deep tunnels for the safe passage
of the torrents which vegetation now conceals. And
among them, wherever her donkey's foot could find
a way, went the woman who devised the work and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
bestowed the guerdon, with the distaff on her saddle,
which gives her to this day the name of Bertha the
spinner.</p>

<p>Yes, it was Bertha, of the Transjurane, who, about
the middle of the tenth century, undertook this work;
opened the old Roman roads; and, in defending her
people against the Saracen hordes, first devised, it may
be, the modern telegraph. A prolonged line from her
Alps to the Jura is still set with the solid stone towers
from which Bertha's sentinels warned each other.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>On the 13th of April, 1809, the French and Bavarian
prisoners held by the Tyrolese at Steinach were
marched to Schwatz, and thence to Salzburg, under
an escort of women: and the prisoners, at least, felt
sufficient confidence in the physical strength of the
guard; for they made no attempt to escape.</p>

<p>"Not a year ago," writes Anna Johnson of Germany,
"I saw a young girl standing up to her knees
in a manure-heap, which she shovelled into a cart, and
then drove to the field. She was hired to do this work
at fourteen dollars a year. On the mountains, the
women were carrying soil and manure to the vines in
baskets, as Queen Bertha taught them nine centuries
ago." A still less pleasant picture may be drawn
from Köhl's "Reminiscences of Montenegro." "Down
among the stones, on the banks of the Fuimera," he
says, "some Cattaro women and girls were washing
and scraping the entrails of the goats that the men
had brought to market. There was one tall, slender,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
handsome girl, dressed in a crimson petticoat, and
jacket embroidered with gold, and her hair elegantly
fastened with golden pins. A pair of richly wrought
slippers lay on the stone beside her; and she laughed
and talked merrily as she washed and scraped away.
At last, she packed the whole into a tub, and lifted it
on her gayly dressed head to carry home. The next
day was Sunday; and I met her, radiant with beauty
and gold embroidery, on her way to church. I often
met these girls carrying on foot the baggage of the
riding-parties."</p>

<p>In 1850, a clergyman of this city tells me that he
saw women, wearing leathern breast-plates, harnessed
to the canal-boats of the Low Countries, and doing
the work of oxen.</p>

<p>In France, we find the same evidences of out-door
work and physical ability. Galignani tells us, that, in
consequence of the success of a certain Madame Isabelle
in breaking horses for the Russian Army, the
French minister of war lately authorized her to proceed
officially before a commission of officers, with
General Régnault de St. Jean d'Angely at their head,
to break some horses for the cavalry. After twenty
days, the animals were so completely broken, that the
minister immediately entered into an arrangement
with her to introduce her system into all the schools
of cavalry in the empire, beginning with that of
Saumur.</p>

<p>Marshal Baraguay d'Hilliers, at Nantes, recently
made a distribution of St. Helena medals to the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
soldiers of the empire. Among the number was a
woman named Jeanne Louise Antonini, who had
served ten years in the navy, and fifteen in the infantry,
where she obtained the rank of non-commisioned officer
in the seventieth regiment of the line. She received
nine wounds while bravely fighting. "It is not
the <em>coat</em> that makes the man," said our marshal when
he gave the medal.</p>

<p>One of the great celebrities of the Invalides was
buried, very lately, with great pomp. This "old
invalid" was an individual of the softer sex,&mdash;the
widow Brulow,&mdash;who entered the army, in 1792, as
a soldier in the forty-second regiment of infantry,
authorized to enlist, in spite of her sex, by General
Casabianca. At Fort Gesco, she was promoted to
the rank of sergeant, after being severely wounded in
the encounter which took place. Perceiving that the
troops were getting short of powder, she set out alone
at midnight for Calvi, roused the women of that place
to the number of sixty, and started them off for Gesco,
laden with powder and ammunition, which enabled
the little fort to hold out eight and forty hours longer,
until relief came. A little after, at the siege of Calvi,
the widow Brulow, while in charge of a gun, was so
desperately wounded that she was forced to renounce
her military career; and none other was open to her
but the retirement of the Invalides, where she was
admitted with the rank of sub-lieutenant. The present
emperor, to whom the widow Brulow was introduced
on his visit to the Invalides, presented her with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the cross of the Legion of Honor and the medal of
St. Helena; her comrades, by acclamation, having
designated her as most worthy of the honor. By a
decree, dated from the imperial headquarters, since
our first edition was printed, we learn that the race
of heroines is not extinct; for two other women, by
that decree, obtained the military medal for their
courage at the battle of Magenta.</p>

<p>There recently died, at Portsea, in England, a
woman, ninety years of age, named Nelly Giles. She
was one of the few surviving witnesses of the battle
of the Nile; having been on board His Majesty's ship
"Bellerophon," in the command of Captain Darby,
and in all subsequent engagements under Nelson.
During the action of the Nile, she was surrounded
by heaps of slain and wounded; and she nursed the
latter tenderly, undismayed by the horrors of the
scene. Three days after the battle, she gave birth to
a son.</p>

<p>The government, in consideration of her great attention
to the sick and wounded, and of the assistance
she gave the surgeons, awarded her a gratuity of seventeen
pounds a year for her life.</p>

<p>A young patriot, named Francisco Riso, was killed
on April 4, 1862, at Palermo, during a popular demonstration
which took place before Garibaldi's arrival.
On April 20, his father, Giovanni Riso, sixty years old,
was shot by the Bourbon soldiers, without so much
as the form of a trial. On the very day that Garibaldi
entered Palermo, a young and beautiful nun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Ignacia Riso, the sister and daughter of the two Risos
named above, left the convent, and, amidst a shower
of balls and grape-shot,&mdash;a cross in one hand, and a
poignard in the other,&mdash;placed herself at the head of
Garibaldi's column, crying, "Down with the Bourbons!
Death to the tyrant! Vengeance!" She kept her place
as long as the fighting lasted; and her courageous
attitude electrified the volunteers. Ever since that
day, the name of Ignacia Riso has been held sacred.
When she passes in the street, the soldiers bow low,
and bless her with the most profound respect. Garibaldi
himself pays her great attention, and loves her
as if she were his own daughter.</p>

<p>From instances like these, refreshing because they
tell of self-imposed labor and eccentric character, we
turn with less pleasure to the statistics of the factories.
Here men have left to women not only the
worst paid but the most unwholesome work of the
respective mills.</p>

<p>Women, in France, are employed in the manufacture
of cotton, silk, and wool. The cotton manufacture
compels two processes which are very injurious,&mdash;the
beating of the cotton, which brings on a
distressing phthisis; and the preparation, or dressing,
which needs a degree of heat not to be endured
after mature age. Both these departments are filled
by women paid at half-prices.</p>

<p>The woollen manufacture compels only one unwholesome
process,&mdash;that of carding; but all the
carders are women at half-wages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>In the silk factories, again, there are two unwholesome
processes entirely carried on by women.
The first is the drawing of the cocoons, where the
hands must be kept constantly in boiling water, and
the odor of the putrefying insects constantly fills the
lungs; the second is carding the floss, the fine lint
of which affects the bronchial tubes. Six out of
every eight women so employed die in a few months.
Healthy young girls from the mountains soon develop
tubercular consumption; and, to complete the
dreadful tale, they are kept upon the lowest wages;
being paid only twenty cents where a man would
earn sixty.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxons, says the historian, "had not
been long settled in England before the more savage
of their traits were softened down. The wife continued
to be regularly purchased by her husband,
and the contract was considered a mere money bargain,
long subsequent to the reign of Ethelbert."
And why? Not because love was mercenary; but
because woman was regarded, in the first place, as
a beast of burden, a laborer. In the "Romany
Rye," we are told that the sale of a wife with a
halter round her neck is still a legal transaction in
England. "It must be done in the cattle-market, as
if she were a mare; all women being considered as
mares by the old English law, and, indeed, called
mares in certain counties where genuine old English
law is still preserved."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Such a sale as this was recently completed at
Worcester, and the agreement between the men was
published in the "Worcester Chronicle."</p>

<p>"Thomas Middleton delivered up his wife Mary
Middleton to Philip Rostins for one shilling and a
quart of ale; and parted wholly and solely for life,
never to trouble one another.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">"Witness. (Signed) <span class="smcap">Thomas</span> × <span class="smcap">Middleton</span>, his mark.</span><br />

<p>I have preserved the old expression <em>mare</em> in my
quotation, to indicate, not the degradation to which
women fell, but that it was as a beast of burden
that men regarded her. Several cases of sales, such
as is here referred to, have occurred within a few
years; but this is the only certificate of transfer
that I ever saw. I desire to direct your attention
to the remarkable fact, that, of the three parties to
it, the wife, who was sold, was the <em>only</em> one who could
write her name. The men signed it by a mark.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
"A generation back," says Cobbett, "it was a common
thing to see women, half naked, working like
beasts, chained to carts, upon the common roads
of England."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>When Lord Ashley's Commission reported, in
1842, five thousand females were at work, more
than a thousand feet below the soil, in the coal-mines
of the north of England. These women were
nearly naked, and drew trucks, in harness, on all-fours,
like beasts of burden. You cannot have forgotten
the remarkable description of such women
in D'Israeli's novel of "The Sibyl."</p>

<p>"They come forth. The plain is covered with
the swarming multitude: bands of stalwart men,
broad-chested and muscular, wet with toil, and black
as the children of the tropics; troops of youth, alas!
of <em>both sexes</em>, though neither their raiment nor their
language indicates the difference. All are clad in
male attire, and oaths that men might shudder to
hear issue from lips born to breathe words of sweetness.
Yet these are to be, some <em>are</em>, the mothers
of England! Can we wonder at the hideous coarseness
of their language, when we remember the savage
rudeness of their lives? Naked to the waist, an iron
chain fastened to a belt of leather runs between
their legs, clad in canvas; while, on hands and feet,
an English girl, for twelve, sometimes for sixteen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
hours a day, hauls and hurries tubs of coal along
subterranean roads, dark, precipitous, and plashy."
These women, <em>called</em> free, were the wretched slaves
of capital. In the life of Stephenson, the railway
engineer, you will find a further account of them,
and may read the chilling answer given by a woman
whom he asked if she had ever heard of Jesus,
"that no such hand had ever worked in her shaft!"
Let the proprietors of English mines remember!
No such hand did ever work in those shafts, yet they
called themselves Christian men! True as death
were the words. If the <em>law</em> is now free of reproach,
the <em>evil</em> has by no means ceased to exist: the Master
still stands knocking.</p>

<p>"Children," wrote Lord Ashley, "are taken to
work when only four years old, girls as well as boys.
Dragging the coal carriages requires the whole strength
of either sex. Young men and women, married
women and married men, work together through the
same number of hours, almost, sometimes quite,
naked, constantly demoralizing each other. It stints
their growth and cripples their limbs." In the east
of Scotland, they still toil up steep ladders from the
shafts.</p>

<p>If it were my purpose to show you moral degradation,
you could hardly bear what I must say; but I
desire only, at this moment, to show you these men
and women <em>working</em>, as Sydney Smith would say, <em>in
the dirt together</em>. In 1842, the Earl of Durham knew
of this; and he and the set with whom he lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
dared, doubtless, to whisper to the ladies in their
halls, that women were not made to labor!</p>

<p>In the calico-mills, girls grind and mix the colors.
They are called <em>teerers</em>. They begin at five years of
age, and labor twelve hours a day, sometimes sixteen;
and are kept late into the night to prepare for
the following day.</p>

<p>In Sedgely and Warrington, the fate of the female
pinmakers is no better. They begin at five years of
age, and work from twelve to sixteen hours a day.
If refractory, they are struck at Wiltenhall with strap,
stick, hammer, or file, in spite of the delicacy of the
sex. In Sedgely, more women are employed than
men; but they do not fare any better: their bodies
are seamed by blows given with bars of burning
iron.</p>

<p>O my sisters! why has God sheltered <em>us</em> in quiet
homes? What have we done to deserve a happier
fate? Why were we not left to writhe beneath
the blows of the smith, or the outrage of a market-sale?</p>

<p>Because God has laid down a responsibility by the
side of every privilege, and requires us to labor not
merely to set such women free, but to establish a
freedom and security <em>by law</em>,&mdash;the law of custom as
well as the law of courts, which we only possess
through usurpation or indulgence.</p>

<p>I will not leave these English shores without alluding
to the physical strength shown by that lovely
paralytic, Anna Gurney. Deprived of the use of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
limbs in very early life, she acquired the Latin, Greek,
and Hebrew, and finally the Teutonic tongues, with a
facility and thoroughness that her Anglo-Saxon translations
show. Men might be excused if they sheltered
from contact with the world this infirm creature,
dependent upon artificial aid for every movement; but
what did she choose for herself?</p>

<p>In 1825, after her mother's death, she went to live
at Northrepps. At her own expense, she procured
one of Manby's apparatus for saving the lives of seamen
cast upon that dangerous coast; and, in cases
of great urgency and peril, she caused herself to be
carried down to the beach, and, from the sick chair
which she wheeled over the sand, directed every
movement for the rescue and recovery of the half-drowned
men.</p>

<p>Look at the pictures! See that grimy, tangled
woman in harness, straining, in full health, along
the coal-shafts! See, nearer, this lovely cripple, the
Quaker cap folded over her soft, brown hair, her soul
erect and noble, doing the duty of a Grace Darling!
The first labors like the brute beast, the victim of
human misgovernment and heathenish ignorance; the
last chooses for herself a conflict with the storm, and
earns, with as full right as any brother, the meed of
the world.</p>

<p>Let us pass over to America. The Caribs of
Honduras are a hardy race, and do not share the prejudices
of Massachusetts on the subject of labor.
Each man has several wives. For each he clears a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
plantation and builds a house. In a year, she has
every kind of breadstuff under cultivation; and hires
creers, which she freights for Truxillo and Belize, her
husband often commanding for her. If her agricultural
labors prove too heavy, as a thrifty woman will
sometimes make them, she hires her husband to work
for her at two dollars a week.</p>

<p>So the Northern Indian glides nimbly through the
woods; while the squaw carries on her unlucky back
their common food and covering, or perhaps hauls
the canoe across the portage. A Jesuit priest rebuked
an Orinoco woman for infanticide. "I wish
<em>my</em> mother had been brave enough to part with me!"
was her reply. "Our husbands go to hunt; and we
drag after them, one baby at the breast, another on
our back. When we return, we cannot sleep, but
must grind maize all night for their chica. Drunken,
they beat us, or stamp us under foot; and, after
twenty years of such labor, a young wife is brought
home to abuse us and such children as we have not
killed. What ought I to do?"</p>

<p>At Santa Cruz, Theodore Parker writes to Francis
Jackson that men and women work together to repair
the public highway; hoeing the earth into trays, and
throwing it into a cart which they drag and push
together.</p>

<p>In Ohio, last year, about thirty girls went from
farm to farm, hoeing, ploughing, and the like, for
sixty-two and a half cents a day. At Media, in
Pennsylvania, two girls named Miller carry on a farm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of three hundred acres; raising hay and grain, hiring
labor, but working mostly themselves. These women
are not ignorant: they at one time made meteorological
observations for an association auxiliary to
the Smithsonian Institute. But labor attracts them,
as it would many women if they were not oppressed
by public opinion.</p>

<p>"In New York," writes a late correspondent of the
"Lily," "I saw women performing the most menial
offices,&mdash;carrying parcels for grocers, and trunks for
steamboats. They often sweep the crossings in
muddy weather; and I once saw one carrying brick
and mortar for a mason."</p>

<p>During the late terrible destruction of property
at the Lawrence mills, the women, heroic in every
department, did not excuse themselves from the severest
labor. When, after hours of extreme exertion,
the firemen, worn down and quite exhausted, called
for help, a bevy of ladies, who were standing on the
sidewalk in Canal Street, flew over to the engines,
and, "manning" the brakes, worked the machine,
amid the cheers of the firemen.</p>

<p>You know what bodily strength and nervous energy
carried Mary Patton round Cape Horn. Well, on the
25th of June, 1858, the British ship "Grotto" left
Cuba; and, on the second day, the yellow-fever broke
out in the worst form. Seven days after, so many
had died, that there remained only the captain, his
wife, and two of the crew. Then the captain was
taken ill; and, beside nursing him, the poor wife, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
had already nursed officers and men, took her station
at the wheel, and steered by his instructions for
Sandy Hook. There the steam-tug "Huntress"
found them, the heroic woman at the wheel, the
husband at that moment struggling with death; and,
when they reached New York, three out of eleven,
one of them the suffering wife, survived to tell the
tale, and show how a woman can work. So common
are such instances becoming, that you have
hardly heard the name of this Mrs. Nichols, for whom
tender charity soon cared.</p>

<p>A mutiny on board the ship "Maria," of New
York, was put down Nov. 10, 1860, by the energy
and decision of the wife of the master, Captain
Clark, who, with pistols in her hands, threatened to
shoot one of the mutineers if he did not desist. He
was cowed into submission; and, a signal being
made to the revenue cutter, the mutineers were taken
into custody. The mate would have been killed,
but for the heroic woman's intrepidity.</p>

<p>But all such labor is the result of compulsion,&mdash;compulsion
of barbarism, of slavery, of unfair competition,
or dire disease. Let us close this branch of
our subject with a picture homely but attractive.
"According to thy request," writes a Quaker friend
from Wilmington, Del., "I send thee some facts concerning
Sarah Ann Scofield. Some fifteen years
since, her father became very much involved in debt.
He owed some ten or twelve hundred dollars; having
lost largely by working for cotton and woollen mills.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
His business was making spindles and fliers. His
daughter, then just sixteen, proposed to go into her
father's shop and assist him; she being the oldest of
seven children. He accepted her offer, and told me
himself, that, in twelve months, she could finish more
work, and do it better, than any man he had ever
trained for eighteen. She earned fifteen dollars a
week at the rate he then paid other hands. Her
father died. Her two oldest brothers learned the
trade <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'of'">off</ins> her, and went away. She has now two
younger sisters in apprenticeship, and a brother fourteen
years of age, all working under her; turning,
polishing, filing, and fitting all kinds of machinery.
I went out to see her last week. She was then making
water-rams to force streams into barns and houses.
She is also beginning to make many kinds of carriage-axles.
She is her own draughtsman, and occasionally
does her own forging. To use her own words,
'What any man can do, I can but try at.' She has
a steam-engine, every part of which she understands;
and I know that her work gives entire satisfaction.
When they have steady employment, they clear sixty
dollars a week; and she says she would rather work
at it for her bread, than at sewing for ten times
the money. The truth is, it is a business she is
fond of."</p>

<p>I have shown you that a very large number of women
are compelled to self-support; that the old idea,
that all men support all women, is an absurd fiction;
and, if you require other evidence than mine, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
may find it in the English courts, under the working
of the new Divorce Bill. Nearly all the women who
have applied for divorces have proved that the subsistence
of the family depended upon them. Out of
six million of British women over twenty-one years
of age, one-half are industrial in their mode of life,
and more than two millions are self-supporting in
their industry like men. Put this fact fully before
your eyes.</p>

<p>Driven to self-support, you have seen, also, that
low wages and comparatively few and overcrowded
avenues of labor compel women to vicious courses
for their daily bread. The streets of Paris, London,
Edinburgh, New York, and Boston, tell us the same
painful story; and in glaring, crimson letters, rises
everywhere the question,&mdash;"Death or dishonor?" I
have shown you that there is encouragement for moral
effort, because these women escape from vice as fast
as they find work to do. "Have they strength for the
conflict," you ask, "or desire to enter such fields?"
Find your answer in what they have done from the
earliest ages, with the foot of Confucius and Vishnu,
of capital and interest, upon their necks. In the
lovely lives of Bertha and Ann Gurney, and the
powerful attraction of Sarah Scofield, you have found
pleasanter pictures whereon to rest your eyes. Let
no man taunt woman with inability to labor, till the
coal-mines and the metal-works, the rotting cocoons
and fuzzing-cards, give up their dead; till he shares
with her, equally at least, the perils of manufactures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and the press of the market. As partners, they must
test and prove their comparative power.</p>

<p>We must next consider what need woman's moral
nature has of work, and what sort of opposition man
practically offers her.</p>

<p class="dropcap">IF low wages, by actually starving women and
those dependent upon them, force many into
vicious courses, so does the want of employment
lower the whole moral tone, and destroy even the
domestic efficiency of those whose minds seek variety
and freedom. More than once have I been to insane
asylums with young girls whom active and acceptable
employment would have saved from mania; and
scores of times have young women of fortune asked
me, "What can you give me to do?"</p>

<p>And to this question there is, in the present state
of the public mind, no possible answer. No woman
of rank can find work, if she do not happen to be
philanthropic, literary, or artistic in her taste, without
braving the influence of home, or, what is next dearest,
the social circle, and earning for herself a position
so conspicuous as to be painful to the most energetic.
The woman who is prepared for all this will not ask
anybody what she is to do: she will take her work
into her own hands, and do it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>That was a pleasant time in the history of the
world, when every woman found, in spinning, weaving,
and sewing, in the active labor of a small or the
skilful management of a large household, full employment
for time and thought, under the cheering shelter
of a husband's or father's smile. That was a pleasant
time also, when, in the middle English classes, women
worked freely by a husband's side, with more
regard to his interest than heed of the world's talk.
But with the wide intellectual culture that America
has been the first country in the world to offer to
women, individual tastes and wishes must develop in
single women; and all men who value the moral
health of society must aid this development.</p>

<p>There is no greater enemy to body and soul than
idleness, unless it be the absurd public sentiment
which compels to idleness. Thousands and tens of
thousands have fallen victims to it. The woman who
will not labor, rich or honored though she be, bends
her head to the inevitable curse of Heaven.</p>

<p>This curse works in failing health, fading beauty,
broken temper, and weary days. Let her never fancy,
that, being neither wife nor mother, she is exempt
from the law: she cannot balance that decree of God
by the foolish customs of society or the weak objections
of her kindred. Never let her say she does not
need to labor. Disease, depression, moral idiocy, or
inertia, follow on an idle life. He who never rests has
made woman in His image; and health, beauty, force,
and influence follow on the steps of labor alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall not pursue this subject; for it is far easier
for you to think it out, than to gather the facts I wish
to bring before you. Read "Shirley," and let the saddest
hours of Caroline Helstone's life bear witness
for thousands who never find a vocation. Read the
"Professor," and let its sweet stimulus kindle in you
some appreciation of the joy which mutual labor can
bring to a happy husband and wife.</p>

<p>Sad, indeed, then, is it when man himself represses
a woman's longing for work, whether from false tenderness,
from a dread of public opinion, a shrinking
from her ultimate independence, or a small personal
jealousy. That he does, in the aggregate and as an
individual, so repress it, is unfortunately matter of
history: it is no invention of an outraged inferior. I
could offer you many private examples of this; but
those that carry proofs of their reality with them will,
I fear, seem very familiar. The first consists in the
opposition shown to the attempt of Mr. Bennett to
establish young women as watchmakers. Honorary
Secretary to the Horological Department of the great
Exhibition, he could not help observing the superiority
of the Genevese watches, in cheapness and convenience
of carriage. In England, watches are so dear
that only the privileged classes can carry them. It
would be for the interests of the manufacturers, of
course, to be able to compete with the Swiss; but they
were too short-sighted to see it. Finding that twenty
thousand women and girls were employed in Switzerland
in the manufacture of watches and watchmakers'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
tools, Mr. Bennett undertook to deliver a public lecture
on the subject. It was interrupted by hisses, and
broken up like a New-York convention. Three well-educated
women then applied to him to be taught;
but no Englishman could be found to take them. A
Swiss, settled in London, did. They made more
progress in six months than ordinary boys in six years;
but they, as well as their teacher, were so cruelly persecuted,
that it was found necessary to relinquish the
attempt. My impression is, though I cannot find the
account in print, that a further effort was made on
a more extended scale, something like a school; and
this was resisted by such combined effort on the part
of the trade, that Mr. Bennett and his friends began
to make a stir through the press. The "Edinburgh
Review" mentions a watchmaker's wife who wished
to work with her husband in his special department.
Finding that it could not be done with the consent of
the trade, she undertook, instead, the engraving of the
brass work; but, though working in her own house,
she was at last successful only under the plea that she
had been regularly apprenticed by her father, also in
the business. She persevered, and taught her two
daughters; and so will many others.</p>

<p>Women in England must certainly make watches;
and the time is not far distant when the men of Coventry
will yield to this demand, as they have already
yielded to others. A few years ago, winding silk,
weaving ribbon, and pasting patterns of floss upon
cards, excited the same opposition; but now thousands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
of women pursue these employments, and the
men look on as quietly as the grazing cattle in the
fields.</p>

<p>"The first steam factory in Coventry," says the
"Edinburgh Review" for October, 1859,&mdash;"a very
small factory,&mdash;was burned down during a quarrel
about wages. Then there was an opposition to the
employment of women at the looms. To this day,
one of the lightest and easiest processes in the manufacture,
which a child might manage, is engrossed by
the men, under heavy penalties."</p>

<p>Fancy a strong man winding silk for a whole day,
or sorting colors in floss! How has he ever degraded
himself to such girls' work?</p>

<p>I need only remind you of the formal petition sent
in at the time of the opening of the School of Design
at Marlborough House, to entreat the Government not
to instruct and aid women, lest the poor, helpless men
should starve! A similar prejudice, much more active
than any in America, prevents English women from
qualifying themselves as physicians. Dr. Spencer, of
Bristol, really educated his daughter as an accoucheuse;
but the prejudice was so strong that she was
not allowed to practise, and became a governess instead.
The same prejudice kept the English Army
suffering for months, while it delayed the departure of
female nurses to the Crimea.</p>

<p>In Staffordshire, women are employed to paint
crockery and china, which they can do with more
taste and grace than men. It seems hardly credible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
that the desire of the men to keep down their wages
should deprive the females of the customary hand-rest;
which would, of course, diminish the fatigue, and
make the pencil-stroke more certain. I am happy to
believe that not an employer in the United States
would submit to this absurd demand; and the result
of any such attempt on the part of workmen would
probably be a general permission to leave. We are,
in this country, much more free from the control of
guilds and unions of various sorts than the people of
England; yet the conduct of our printers furnishes a
fair parallel to these foreign facts. Within a few
years, there have been more than twenty strikes in
printing-offices, consequent upon the employment of
a few women; and the result has generally been an
entire change of hands, masters in America not enduring
dictation.</p>

<p>In August of 1854, the journeymen employed in
the office of the "Philadelphia Daily Register" left
the office, in high dudgeon, because the publisher had
employed two women as type-setters in a separate
office. They acted in conformity to a resolve of the
Printers' Union, and were permitted to depart. But
this was not all. Threats of personal violence followed
all who sought the waiting work, and an attempt
was made to cut the rope by which the forms
are raised. The result would have been to break up
the type, prevent the issue of the paper, and run the
risk of endangering life. Complaints were lodged
against the printers; and, after a hearing, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
each held to bail in six hundred dollars, to answer to
the charge of conspiracy, at the Court of Quarter
Sessions.</p>

<p>About the same time, a printer in the same establishment
with the "Lily," but working on the "Home
Visitor," refused to give some necessary instruction to
a girl employed on the first paper. It was found that
all the hands had signed an agreement never to work
with or instruct a woman! The men, after proper
remonstrance, were dismissed, and their places supplied
by four women and three men, who worked harmoniously
together. That was only five years ago,
and now there are hundreds of female printers in
Ohio; and one orphan girl has risen from type-setting
to an editor's chair and a handsome competence.</p>

<p>Jealousy in America sometimes takes a more comical
form. Coming home lately from a Female School
of Design in another city, I expressed some disappointment
at the character of the work and management.
A young man in the room spoke of the impossibility
of a woman's ever learning to design, in terms so
contemptuous that I did not think it worth while to
answer him. Making some inquiries, however, in
private, I found that his master had often reproached
him with <em>falling behind the women</em> at the school; so
that personal pique had more to do with the whole
thing than any real experience.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>But, having made these remarks, I must recur to
my previous statement,&mdash;that, in the main, no jealousy
of cliques, no legal restrictions, prevent women
from taking their proper place. A want of respect
for woman, and a want of respect for labor, latent
and unacknowledged in the public mind, must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
overcome before she can do it. The overworked and
ill-paid woman has seized every chance to slight her
work; and an idea has gone abroad, that no slop-work
will be fit for sale unless a man inspects it. So New
York and Paris have man-tailors and man-milliners;
and the poor, tempted, stricken girls are brought into
contact, in the pursuit of bread, with the very men
most likely to take advantage of every failure. Very
sad stories could be told of work rejected day after
day, on account of pretended faults, till the starving
victim drops at the feet of the treacherous overseer,
only to be trampled, in the end, under those of the
whole town. Educated, respectable women should
have the giving-out and the inspection of woman's
work; but educated and respectable women will never
stand in such a position till public opinion teaches
them that all <em>labor</em> is honorable, and that no lady will
ever sit with folded hands. How we rate an idle boy!
how we bear with a dawdling girl! That father
grows impatient whose son does not rise early, or
show some desire for employment; but the same man
keeps his daughters in Berlin wool and yellow novels,
and looks to marriage as their salvation, even when
he blushes to be told of it.</p>

<p>To prove this, let me show you that many employments
have been open to a degree not generally acknowledged;
and a safe foundation for this assertion
will be found in the census of the United Kingdom
and that of the United States.</p>

<p>It is a singular fact, that there are a great many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
more women in England in business for themselves
than employed as tenders or clerks; while, in America,
the fact, at the present day, is directly the reverse.</p>

<p>It was not so in the time of the Revolution. Then,
as in France, the men went to the war. Women of
shrewdness and ability managed their husbands' affairs,&mdash;the
shops and trades of the nation,&mdash;and
grew so independent thereby, that even Mrs. John
Adams had to rebuke her husband for the absurd
inequalities of privilege which his new government
sustained. In England, the deficient education of
the lower classes makes it almost impossible for the
women to make change quickly, or keep accounts;
and we smile as we find the "Edinburgh Review"
gravely contending that woman may master the rule
of three; that, at least, they ought to have a chance
to <em>try</em>: and we can afford to smile; for our public
schools have taught us how much quicker most women
can count than most men. While, therefore, the
want of education has prevented a certain class of
English women from becoming clerks or book-keepers,
the national habits of thrift, and a certain respectable
pride in a family shop or trade, have induced thousands
of a superior class to assume, upon a father's or
husband's death, the charge of his establishment, and
so secure a competence for the heirs. This is what
we could wish our women to do. We all know how
frequently the whole social position of a family here
changes with the death of its head. Let our women
prevent this for the future, by cherishing a natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
ambition to do for their children what the fathers of
those children would have done.</p>

<p>The last census of the United Kingdom shows,
that, while the female population has increased in
such proportion that there are now <em>eight women</em> where
there were <em>seven</em>, there are <em>eight working</em> women where
there were only <em>six</em>; that is, there are more new
workers than new women. There are 1,250,000 women
earning their own bread as independently as any
men. Of these, there are&mdash;</p>

<ul class="index">
 <li class="ifrst">385,000 employed in Textile manufactures,</li>
 <li class="isub1">&nbsp; 40,000 in Metal-works, and</li>
 <li class="isub1">128,418 in Agriculture.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope these statements will not seem useless and
superficial to you.</p>

<p>This hour cannot be better employed than in opening
to you some of the mysteries of woman's work in
England.</p>

<p>Among the 128,418 women employed in Agriculture,
there are 64,000 dairy-women; not women who
tend a single cow for a single family, but women of
muscle, who wield large tubs and heavy presses, who
turn cheeses and slap butter by the hundred-weight.
Then there are market-gardeners, who not only raise
their stock, but drive it to the town for sale; bee-mistresses
and florists, of whom there are many
among the Quakers; flax-producers, who not only
raise the pretty blue-eyed flowers, but beat the silicious
fibres apart; and they are followed by hay-makers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
reapers, and hop-pickers, gracefully garlanding
the group.</p>

<p>Naturally connected with this first interest of the
soil is the second, or Mining. It is no longer considered
fit for women to work in shafts, though the
need of bread forces many to evade the law. The
census, however, cannot touch them: the seven thousand
women it reports as engaged in Mining are
employed in dressing and sorting ore, and as washers
and strainers of clay for the potteries,&mdash;heavy and
disagreeable if not unfit work.</p>

<p>The next largest interest is that of the Fisheries.
The Pilchard fishery employs many thousands of
women. Jersey oysters alone employ over one thousand.
Then come the&mdash;</p>

<ul class="index">
 <li class="ifrst">Herring,</li>
 <li class="isub1">Cod,</li>
 <li class="isub1">Whale, and</li>
 <li class="isub1">Lobster fisheries.</li>
</ul>

<p>The work in connection with the whale fishery consists
chiefly in what is done after the cargo is landed.
Apart from the Christie Johnstones,&mdash;the aristocrats
of the trade,&mdash;the sea nurtures an heroic class, like
Grace Darling, who stand aghast, as she did, when
society rewards a deed of humanity, and cry out in
expostulation, "Why, every girl on the coast would
have done as I did!"</p>

<p>In natural connection with these come the&mdash;</p>

<ul class="index">
 <li class="ifrst">Kelp-burners, the</li>
 <li class="isub1">Netters, and the</li>
 <li class="isub1">Bathers,</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>or women who manage the bathing machines used
on the coast. Then come two hundred thousand
female servants; of which, largest in number, shortest
in life, and, of course, the worst paid, are the general
housemaids, or unhappy servants-of-all-work. Then
come&mdash;</p>

<ul class="index">
 <li class="ifrst">Brewers,</li>
 <li class="isub1">Custom-house and Police searchers,</li>
 <li class="isub1">Matrons of jails,</li>
 <li class="isub1">Lighthouse-keepers, and</li>
 <li class="isub1">Pew-openers.</li>
</ul>

<p>I cannot mention the Matrons of jails, without a sigh,
when I remember, that at our common jail and at
Charlestown there is no proper matron; and sickness,
death, and childbirth meet only with such care as
women detained as witnesses, or inebriates, can offer.
Surely a Christian community should furnish Christian,
womanly ministrations to its prisoners; and I
would that some noble soul in an able body might
be found to take up this work! Pew-opening has
never been a trade in this community; but, as there
are signs that it may become so, I advise our women
to keep an eye upon it!</p>

<p>There are in the United Kingdom&mdash;</p>

<ul class="index">
 <li class="ifrst">500,000 business-women,</li>
 <li class="isub1">&nbsp; 94,000 shoemakers' wives,</li>
 <li class="isub1">&nbsp; 27,000 victuallers' wives,</li>
 <li class="isub1">&nbsp; 26,000 butcheresses,</li>
 <li class="isub1">&nbsp; 14,000 milk-women,</li>
 <li class="isub1">&nbsp; 10,000 beershop-keepers,</li>
 <li class="isub1">&nbsp; &nbsp; 9,000 innkeepers, and</li>
 <li class="isub1">&nbsp; &nbsp; 8,000 hack proprietors.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>The difference between the employers and the
employed is shown in the following numbers. There
are&mdash;</p>

<ul class="index">
 <li class="ifrst">29,000 shopkeepers, and only</li>
 <li class="isub1">&nbsp; 1,742 shopwomen;</li>
</ul>

<p>since the lower class of English women are seldom
taught writing or accounts.</p>

<p>Telegraphic Reporters, Phonographers, and Railway-clerks,
are on the increase. In reporting the
Bright Festival at Manchester last year, the speed
and accuracy of the young women were thought very
remarkable. Six whole columns were transmitted at
the rate of twenty-nine words a minute, almost without
mistake, although the subject of the speeches was
political, and so supposed to be beyond their comprehension!</p>

<p>Several railways employ women as clerks and
ticket-sellers, and the results are more than satisfactory.
Thus far the census; which has not been without
its interest, since, in English parlance, shoemaker-wife
means not merely the wife of a shoemaker, but
a wife who shares her husband's labor, or has succeeded
to it on his death. Butcher-wife also means
a woman who can buy and sell stock, pickle meat,
and perhaps drive a cart through the town.</p>

<p>Now for the results of some private letters. When
I spoke of forty thousand Metal-workers, your minds
did not revert, I trust, to those dens at Wiltenhall,
where women have been struck with hammers, files,
and even bars of iron glowing at a white heat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, at least, let us visit a pleasanter scene. A
man has forged and rolled out the sheet which is soon
to pass for a hundred gross of Gillott's pens; but a
woman cuts and bends and stamps, grinds, splits,
polishes, and packs it, so that her sisters may have
pleasure in the using.</p>

<p>It was at Birmingham that your gold chain was
made. A man's strength drew out the precious wire;
but hundreds of young girls cut it to the required
length, shaped it on a metal die to the required pattern,
soldered it invisibly over a jet of gas-light,
ground the facets till they gleamed and polished the
whole length to tempt the gazer's eye. Quiet, diligent,
skilful, tidy, they sit; with polished slippers
bobbing along the floor; not quite so healthy as
those who labor on the pens, for the gas and solder
do an unwholesome work. Others burnish the silver
plate, sort needles, paint iron and papier-maché trays;
and hundreds more are busy cutting and polishing
screws,&mdash;a work mainly in their hands, because
men cannot be trusted with the delicate manipulation.</p>

<p>There is a covered button, my brother, on your
coat. Women cut the metal, the cloth cover, the
paper stuffing, the silk lining; a child piles these in
proper order; and, by one stroke of a magic press,
a woman throws them out a finished button.</p>

<p>One young girl in London began life by designing
for such buttons, till she found that she had a soul
above them, and cheerfully entered an artistic career.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Nail-cutting and hook-and-eye making employ others;
and, if we take a book into our hand, women
follow us through all the stages of its manufacture.
A woman cut and cleaned the rags, counted the
sheets of paper, and set off the reams; a woman may
have set the types; perhaps some worn-out seamstress
wrote the verses, or a female physician composed the
thesis: a woman <em>may</em> print, a woman certainly <em>will</em>
fold it down and stitch it for the binder. A woman
will engrave on wood its illustrations, or color in her
own home its fine photographs or drawings: at the
very last, her white hand will touch with gleams of
gold its tinted edges or many-hued envelope.</p>

<p>It is women who pack cards and throw off damaged
paper. I have not obtained any reliable account
of English female card-makers; but there must be
many. In an old Nuremberg rate-book are the names
of "Elizabeth and Margaret," <em>Karten-mächerin</em>, reported
in 1436 and 1438. Cards were invented in
1361. In about seventy years, therefore, the manufacture
had passed into woman's hand. In my notes
from the census, I find no mention of wood-engravers:
but, in 1839, Charlotte Nesbit, Marianne Williams,
Mary Byfield, Mary and Elizabeth Clint, held honorable
positions among English wood-engravers; while,
at the close of the last century, Elizabeth Blackwell
executed botanical plates, and Angelica Kauffman
engraved on steel, to the satisfaction of Sir Joshua
Reynolds. In London, recently, one accomplished female
engraver has turned her steel plates into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
pleasant country-house, which she means to furnish
with the proceeds of her delicate painting on
glass.</p>

<p>A whole volume might be written concerning English
female printers. Turning over some old books
the other day in the Antiquarian Rooms at Worcester,
I came upon Elizabeth Bathurst's "Truth Vindicated,"
printed and sold by Mary Hinde, at No. 2 in
George's Yard, Lombard Street, 1774. A little farther
along, I found Sophia Hume's "Letters to South
Carolina," printed and sold by Luke Hinde, at the
Bible in George's Yard, Lombard Street, 1752. Good
Quaker books, both of them; and the titlepages told
a pleasant story. Here, at the sign of the Bible,
Luke Hinde carried on his work in 1752. When he
died, his widow kept the establishment open, and
taught her girls to stand at the forms; so, twenty-two
years after (in 1774), the place goes on in her name.
No change; only some dissenting wind has blown
down the Old Bible, and a gilded number two shines
in its stead. It is the history of half the business-women
in England, and a very creditable history for
Mary Hinde.</p>

<p>On those dishes of Liverpool ware are pretty pictures
in gray ink. Women took them wet from the
copperplate, and, laying them along the biscuit, carried
it to the furnace; there the paper burns away:
while others paint and gild, or, with hideous clatter
of blood-stones, polish off the finer ware.</p>

<p>In the next street, hundreds of women make paperbags<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
and pill-boxes, without wasting a square inch of
material.</p>

<p>Not long ago, two young girls, whose father's clerkship
was ill paid, took to making artificial teeth, and
succeeded so well as to obtain constant orders and a
competence. More cheering still: a young servant,
with strong elbows, took to French polishing, and
gave desk and work-box and inlaid cabinet a gloss
that no varnish of man could match. For two or
three years she made contracts with upholsterers, and
kept herself in profitable work: then Cupid pinched
the strong elbows, and she slipped out of permanent
reputation as a cabinetmaker's wife.</p>

<p>In brushmaking, women sort the hair, and set it in
the holes. The delicate, cone-like arrangement of the
badger's hair, in the modern shaving-brush, can be
made only by a woman's hand; and she who has
skill to do it well may ask her own wages.</p>

<p>Then there are glove-cleaners; women who strain
silk, in fluting, across the old-fashioned work-bag or
the parlor-organ front; women who shell pease and
beans at so much a quart, and who make the thousands
of baskets for the fruiterer's stall. Passing the
white-lead factory at meal-times, you will see fifty
women file away, whose duty it is to pile the lead for
oxidation; and thousands, very different from these,
sit making artificial flowers, many of them cheap
enough, but others, from their exquisite grace and
naturalness, bringing the artist's own price.</p>

<p>I have purposely dwelt on all these avocations. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
you have followed me, has it seemed to you that we
wanted more avenues for manual labor? As many
as you please. We are bound to inherit the whole
earth. But it seems to me that what is most needed
is, first, respect for woman as a laborer, and then
respect for labor itself.</p>

<p>When men respect women as human beings, consequently
as laborers, they will pay them as good wages
as men; and then uncommon skill or power to work
will be set free from the old forcing-pump and siphon,
and we shall see what women can do. When men
respect labor,&mdash;respect it so far, that they hold a
woman honored when she seeks it,&mdash;then women of
a higher rank will seek to invest their capital in mercantile
experiments; will establish factories or workshops;
will organize groups of struggling sisters; and
the class that most needs to be helped, the idle rich,
will find happiness and honor, will find help, in offering
opportunities to the lowest.</p>

<p>What the lowest class of women need is active
brains to plan and think for them. There are plenty
of these active brains at the West End, tingling with
neuralgia, hot with idleness, dizzy with waltzing.
Offer a government testimonial to the first girl of
rank who will carry her brains to a market, and you
will see what a throng of aspirants we shall have;
letting it be understood, mind you, that the public
feeling sustains the government testimonial.</p>

<p>Let us ask, then, a few questions about the state
of female labor in the United States. Our census is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
by no means so complete as that of Great Britain;
and our statements will, therefore, be less accurate.</p>

<p>At the close of the Revolution, there were in New
England, and perhaps farther south, many women
conducting large business establishments, and few
females employed as clerks, partly because we were
still English, and had not lost English habits. Men
went to the war or the General Court, and their
wives soon learned to carry on the business upon
which not only the family bread, but the fate of the
nation, depended; while our common schools had
not yet begun to fit women for book-keepers and
clerks.</p>

<p>The Island of Nantucket was, at the close of the
war, a good example of the whole country. Great
destitution existed on the establishment of peace.
The men began the whale fishery with redoubled
energy: some fitted out and others manned the ships;
while the women laid aside distaff and loom to attend
to trade. A very interesting letter from Mrs. Eliza
Barney to Mr. Higginson gives me many particulars.
"Fifty years ago," she says, "all the dry-goods and
groceries were kept by women, who went to Boston
semi-annually to renew their stock. The heroine
of 'Miriam Coffin' was one of the most influential
of our commercial women. She not only traded in
dry-goods and provisions, but fitted vessels for the
merchant service. Since that time, I can recall near
seventy women who have successfully engaged in
commerce, brought up and educated large families,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and retired with a competence. It was the influence
of capitalists from the Continent that drove the
Nantucket women out of the trade; and they only
resumed it a few years since, when the California
emigration made it necessary. Five dry-goods and
a few large groceries are now carried on by women,
as also one druggist's shop." Mrs. Gaskell, in her
"Life of Charlotte Bronté," mentions a woman living
as a druggist, I think, at Haworth; and I have always
been surprised that this business was not left to
women. Our Nantucket druggist is doing well. In
Pennsylvania, the Quaker view of the duties and
rights of women contributed to throw many into
trade at the same period. One lady in Philadelphia
transferred a large wholesale business to two nephews,
and died wealthy. I saw a letter the other day,
which gave an interesting account of two girls who
got permission there to sell a little stock in their
father's shop. One began with sixty-two cents,
which she invested in a dozen tapes. The other had
three dollars. In a few years, they bought their
father out. The little tape-seller married, and carried
her husband eight thousand dollars; while the single
sister kept on till she accumulated twenty thousand
dollars, and took a poor boy into partnership.</p>

<p>I have spoken of English female printers. The
first paper ever issued in Rhode Island was printed
by a brother of Dr. Franklin, at Newport. He died
early, and his widow continued the work. She was
aided by her two daughters, swift and correct compositors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
She was made printer to the Colony, and,
in 1745, printed an edition of the laws, in 346 folio
pages. That she found time to do something else,
you may judge from this advertisement:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The printer hereof prints linens, calicoes, silk, &amp;c., in
figures, in lively and durable colors, without the offensive
smell which commonly attends linen printed here."</p></blockquote>

<p>Margaret Draper printed the "Boston News Letter,"
and was so good a Tory that the English Government
pensioned her when the war drove her away.
Clementina Bird edited and printed the "Virginia
Gazette," and Thomas Jefferson wrote for her paper.
Penelope Russell also printed the "Censor," in Boston,
in 1771.</p>

<p>When we record these things, and think how
women are pressing into printing-offices in our time,
it is pleasant to find a generous action to sustain them.
At a recent Printers' Convention held in Springfield,
Ill., the following resolution was adopted:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<em>Whereas</em>, The employment of females in printing-offices
as compositors has, wherever adopted, been found a decided
benefit as regards moral influence and steady work, and also
as offering better wages to a deserving class; therefore,
be it&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>Resolved</em>, That this Association recommends to its members
the employment of females whenever practicable."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Barney tells us that failures were very uncommon
in Nantucket while women managed the
business; and some of the largest and safest fortunes
in Boston were founded by women, one of whom, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
remember, rode in her own chariot, and kept fifty
thousand dollars in gold in the chimney corner, lest
the banks should not be as cautious in their dealings
as herself. While writing these pages, I have visited
such a woman, still living in Prince Street, at the age
of ninety-five. Her name is Hillman. She lived for
sixty-four years in the same house, and made her
property by a large grocery business, and speculations
on a strip of real estate. Her father, Mr. William
Haggo, was a nautical-instrument maker; and she has
a very remarkable head, and as conservative a horror
of modern changes&mdash;steam-bakeries, for instance&mdash;as
any of you could wish.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Some of you will remember
the two sisters Johnson, who, for more than half
a century, kept a crockery-shop on Hanover Street,
and separated about two years ago,&mdash;one sister
to retire on her earnings; the other to rest in a
quiet grave, at the age of fourscore. The spirit of
modern improvement has since seized hold of the
old shop.</p>

<p>It was one of the most distinguished of our female
merchants&mdash;Martha Buckminster Curtis&mdash;who
planted, in Framingham, the first potatoes ever set in
New England; and you will start to hear that our
dear and honored friend Ann Bent entered on her
business career so long ago as 1784, at the age of sixteen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>She first entered a crockery-ware and dry-goods
firm; but, at the age of twenty-one, established herself
in Washington, north of Summer Street, where
we remember her. She soon became the centre of a
happy home, where sisters, cousins, nieces, and young
friends received her affectionate care. The intimacy
which linked her name to that of Mary Ware is fresh
in all our minds. What admirable health she contrived
to keep we may judge from the fact, that she
dined at one brother's table on Thanksgiving Day for
over fifty years. She was the valued friend of Channing
and Gannett; and her character magnified her
office, ennobled her condition, gave dignity to labor,
and won the love and respect of all the worthy.
Less than two years ago, at the age of ninety, she
left us; but I wished to mention both her and Miss
Kinsley in this connection, because they were the first
women in our society to confer a merchantable value
upon taste.</p>

<p>Instead of importing largely themselves, they bought
of the New-York importers the privilege of selection,
and always took the prettiest and nicest pieces out of
every case. As they paid for this privilege themselves,
so they charged their customers for it, by asking a
little more on each yard of goods than the common
dealer.</p>

<p>I know nothing for which it is pleasanter to pay
than for taste. When time is precious (and to all
serious people it soon becomes so), it is a comfort to
go to one counter, sure that in ten minutes you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
purchase what it would take a whole morning to winnow
from the countless shelves of the town.</p>

<p>Scientific pursuits cannot be said to be fairly opened
to women here. The two ladies at work on the
Coast Survey were employed by special favor, and
probably on account of near relationship to the gentleman
who had charge of the department of latitudes
and longitudes. Their work is done at home. Some
years ago, Congress made an appropriation for an
American nautical almanac; and Lieut. Davis was
appointed to take charge of it. Three ladies were at
one time employed upon the lunar tables. Lieut.
Davis told one of them that he preferred the women's
work, because it was quite as accurate, and much
more neat, than the men's. In 1854, Maria Mitchell
was employed in computing for this almanac, with
the same salary that would be given to a man. I
may say, in this connection, that a great number of
female clerks have been employed in Washington for
many years. The work has generally been obtained
by women who had lost a husband or a father in the
service of his country; and, I am proud to say, such
women have usually been paid the same wages as
men. During Mr. Fillmore's administration, two
women wrote for the Treasury, on salaries of twelve
hundred and fifteen hundred dollars a year; but the
succeeding administration reformed this abuse, and
very few are now at work.</p>

<p>In 1845, there were employed in the Textile manufactures
of the United States, 55,828 men and 75,710<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
women. This proportion, or a still greater preponderance
of female labor,&mdash;that is, from one-third to
one-half,&mdash;appears in all the factory returns. As an
<em>employed</em> class, women seem to be more in number
than men: as <em>employers</em>, they are very few. The
same census reports them as&mdash;</p>

<p>I think you cannot fail to see, from this list, how
very imperfect the enumeration is: not a single washerwoman
nor charwoman, for one thing, upon it.
Yet here you have the occupations of 4,970 women.
Of these, 4,046 are servants,&mdash;a number which has,
at least, doubled since then; and which leaves only
924 women for all other avocations.</p>

<p>In New York, Mr. Jobson, formerly surgeon-dentist
to Victoria, offers to instruct women in the duties of
a dentist. I do not know that he has a single practising
pupil; but he asserts that some of the most distinguished
dentists in Europe are women. A few years
since, the town of Ashfield elected two women and
three men to the duties of a School Committee,&mdash;duties
for which women are greatly to be preferred.
A letter from the senior lady shows that one of them at
least never attempted to do the actual work to which
she was called, considering it <em>out</em> of her sphere! Does
any one in this audience suppose that those women
felt incapable of the duty? We know better; but
they were not of the stuff of which martyrs are made,
and, deferring to popular views, set aside a sacred
opportunity. They might have so done that work as
to have secured the election of women for ever after.</p>

<p>The occupations of which the census takes no
account may be classed as&mdash;</p>

<ul class="index">
 <li class="ifrst">Professions,</li>
 <li class="isub1">Public Offices,</li>
 <li class="isub1">Semi-professions, and Arts.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the Professions come&mdash;</p>

<ul class="index">
 <li class="ifrst">Physicians,</li>
 <li class="isub1">Lawyers,</li>
 <li class="isub1">Ministers,</li>
</ul>

<p>of which there are increasing numbers.</p>

<p>Under Public Offices we find&mdash;</p>

<ul class="index">
 <li class="ifrst">Postmistresses,</li>
 <li class="isub1">Registers of Deeds,</li>
 <li class="isub1">The few calculators at Washington, and</li>
 <li class="isub1">School-committee women at the West.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is probably known to you all how largely the
rural post-office duties are performed by women;
petty politicians obtaining the appointment, and leaving
wives and daughters to do the work. There are
several Registers of Deeds; but I know only one,&mdash;Olive
Rose, of Thomaston, Me. She was elected in
1853, by 469 votes against 205; was officially notified,
and required to give bonds. Her emolument depends
upon fees, and ranges between three and four hundred
dollars per annum. She continues to perform the
duties of her office, and, if an exquisitely clear hand-writing
is of service there, will probably never be
displaced.</p>

<p>Under the head of Semi-professions come&mdash;</p>

<ul class="index">
 <li class="ifrst">Teachers,</li>
 <li class="isub1">Librarians,</li>
 <li class="isub1">Editors,</li>

 <li class="isub1">Designers,</li>
 <li class="isub1">Engravers,</li>
 <li class="isub1">Public Singers, and Actresses.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am sorry to conclude these attempts at statistics
with one reliable estimate, which holds, like a nutshell,
the kernel of this question of female labor.</p>

<p>In 1850, there were engaged in shoemaking, in the
town of Lynn, 3,729 males and 6,412 females,&mdash;nearly
twice as many women as men; yet, in the
monthly payment of wages, only half as much money
was paid to women as to men. The three thousand
men received seventy-five thousand dollars a month;
and the six thousand women, thirty-seven thousand
dollars: that is, the women's wages were, on the average,
only one-quarter as much as those of the men.</p>

<p>If we inquire into details, we may find many exceptional
causes at work, not perceptible at first sight:
still this remarkable fact remains essentially unchanged.</p>

<p>In my first lecture, I showed you that women were
starving, and that vice is a better paymaster than
labor. I showed you the awful falsity of the cry,
"Do not let women work: we will work for them.
They are too tender, too delicate, to bide the rough
usage of the world." I showed you that they were
not only working hard, but had been working at hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
and unwholesome work, not merely in this century,
but in all centuries since the world began. I showed
you how man himself has turned them back, when
they have entered a well-paid career. Practically,
the command of society to the uneducated class is,
"Marry, stitch, die, or do worse."</p>

<p>Plenty of employments are open to them; but all
are underpaid. They will never be better paid till
women of rank begin to work for money, and so
create a respect for woman's labor; and women of
rank will never do this till American men feel what
all American men profess,&mdash;a proper respect for
Labor, as God's own demand upon every human
soul,&mdash;and so teach American women to feel it.
How often have I heard that every woman willing to
work may find employment! The terrible reverses
of 1837 taught many men in this country that they
were "out of luck:" how absurd, then, this statement
with regard to women! One reason why so
many young women are attracted to the Catholic
Church is, that the Catholic Church is a good
economist, and does not tolerate an idle member. In
Catholic countries,&mdash;nay, in Protestant,&mdash;the gray
hood of the Sister of Charity is as sacred as a crown.</p>

<p>When I think how happy human life might be, if
men and women worked freely together, I lose patience.
Such marriages as I can dream of,&mdash;where,
household duties thriftily managed and speedily discharged,
the wife assumes some honorable trust, or
finds a noble task for her delicate hands; while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
husband follows his under separate auspices! Occupied
with real service to men and each other, how
happily would they meet at night to discuss the hours
they had lived apart, to help each other's work by
each other's wit, and to draw vital refreshment from
the caresses of their children! It is your distrust, O
men! that prevents your having such homes as poets
fancy. You will not help women to form them.
The sturdy pine pushes through the tightest soil, and
will grow, though nothing more genial than a November
sky bid it welcome; but tender anemones&mdash;wind-flowers,
as we call them&mdash;must be coaxed
through the loose loam sifted from thousands of autumn
leaves, and tremble to the faintest air. Yet are
anemones fairer than the pine, and their lovely blossoming
a fit reward for Nature's pains. Follow Nature,
and offer the encouragement which those you
love best daily need. Do it for your own sakes; for
proper employment will diffuse serenity over the anxious
faces you are too apt to see. Do not fancy that
the conventions of society can ever prevail over the
will, it may be the freak, of Nature. That stepdame
is absolute. She set Hercules spinning, and sent
Joan of Arc to Orleans. She taught Mrs. John
Stuart Mill political economy, and Monsieur Malignon
netting and lace-work. She enables women
to bear immense burdens, heat, cold, and frost; she
sets them in the thick of the battle even; while in
South Carolina, and in the heart of Africa, or among
the Indians of the Rocky Mountains, old men croon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
over forsaken babes till the milk flows in to their
withered breasts.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Women want work for all the reasons that men
want it. When they see this, and begin to do it
faithfully, you will respect their work, and pay them
for it. We are all taught that we are the children of
God; only Mohammedans deny their women that
rank: yet we are left without duties, as if such a
thing were possible,&mdash;left without work that offers
any adequate <em>end</em> as a stimulus to diligence or ambition;
and, until "Work" becomes man's cry of inspiration,
woman will never train herself to do her
work well.</p>

<p>It was Margaret Fuller, I think, who wrote of the
Polish heroine, the Countess Emily Plater, "<em>She</em> is
the figure I want for my frontispiece. Short was her
career. Like the Maid of Orleans, she only lived
long enough to <em>verify her credentials</em>, and then passed
from a scene on which she was probably a premature
apparition." Ah! that is what all women should do,&mdash;verify
their credentials! "Say what you please,"
said a young girl to her lover, as they passed out of
a Woman's Convention; "a woman that <em>can</em> speak
like Lucretia Mott, <em>ought</em> to speak." And men themselves
cannot escape from this conviction. The duty
of women, therefore, is to inspire it by doing whatever
they undertake worthily and well; patient in
waiting for opportunities, prompt to seize, conscientious
to profit by them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>The Sorbonne, which still excludes woman from its
courses and colleges, has formed a separate course,
and now institutes examinations, and distributes diplomas
for women. The Committee consists of three
of the Inspectors of the University, two Catholic
priests, one Protestant clergyman, and three ladies.</p>

<p>A daughter of the greatest living French poet
passed the examination lately for the mere honor of
it. Another girl, the daughter of one of the highest
public functionaries, passed the examinations; going
through the winter twilight every morning at five,
that she might not only be permitted to found a
school on her estate, but secure the right to teach in
it. Aware that her rank would befriend her, she concealed
her name that she might owe nothing to favor.
That is the right spirit. When a majority, or even a
plurality, of women are capable of it, farewell to lecturers
and lectures, to conventions, special pleadings,
and the like! The whole harvest will be open, and
the laborers will come, bringing their sheaves with
them.</p>

<p>In receiving lately a letter from a distinguished
French author,&mdash;Madame Sirault,&mdash;I was struck
by the following sentence: "Every career from which
woman is steadily repulsed by man is, by this fact
alone, marked with the seal of death. The very repulse
stigmatizes it. Man may not be conscious of
what he does; but the career which is too vile for a
woman to enter has outlived all chance of reform,
and must perish with its abuses."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>And, heroic as this statement may seem to you, it
is a simple statement of fact. Can man demand of
woman a higher purity, a more ideal Christian grace,
than the letter of the Scripture, than the spirit of
Christ, demands of man himself?&mdash;"Be ye therefore
perfect, as your Father in heaven is also perfect."</p>

<p>That was the clear command laid upon the simple
fishermen, upon Luke the physician and Matthew
the publican, as well as upon Mary and Martha.
The world's eyes are slowly opening to the need of a
pure life in men; and it helps to show men what
they ought to be, when women knock at the doors of
their workshops, and insist on entering.</p>

<p>"What!" says the soldier, "must my sister follow
me to the field to take this blood-stained hand; to see
me decked in the spoils of fallen men; or hunting unprotected
women like a brute beast, till they fall senseless
on the bodies of those they loved?"</p>

<p>"Shut her out!" cries the minister of state. "Shall
my <em>sister</em> see these hands, dripping with blood-money,
bribed by a slave power or a party interest, signing
papers that condemn children yet unborn to the
miseries of hopeless war?"</p>

<p>"Shut her out!" cries the advocate. "I am preparing
to defend this man for luring helpless innocence
to the brink of hell, for building up a fortune on
dollars wrung from starving women, for putting a
bullet through his brother because he did not live
a life purer than his own."</p>

<p>"Turn her out!" cries the judge. "She will see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
that my scales are loaded. She heard that railroad
company offer me a bribe. She caught a whisper
just now from the husband of yonder outraged woman.
She will hear the liquor dealer's counsel, and
see the golden lure that South Carolina offers when
the fugitive stands at the bar. Turn her out!"</p>

<p>"Turn her out!" says the physician. "Shall she
hear me jeer at what she deems holy? Would you
have her grow shameless also?"</p>

<p>"Shut her out," says the trader, "while I mark my
goods! This spool of cotton is short fifty yards:
mark it two hundred. This yard of muslin was
made at Manchester: sew on the Paris tack. This
shawl was woven in France: label it Cashmere.
Color that cheese with annatto, weigh down that
butter with salt, dilute that rose-water from the spring,
grate up turnip to mix with that horseradish; but
turn that woman out!"</p>

<p>"Turn her out!" cries the priest, last of all.
"Polemics and theology have no charms for her.
She will ask me why I do not do justly and love
mercy. Turn her out!"</p>

<p>"Turn her out!" and, in the shudder which creeps
over him while he speaks, man sees not only how
tender and strong is his love for the sister that hung
on the same maternal bosom; but he sees also what
the gospel without and the gospel within demand of
the son no less than the daughter of God.</p>

<p>Farewell to war, to statecraft, to legal tricks, to
shifts of trade; farewell to bribery, to desecration, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
idle controversy,&mdash;when woman enters in to man's
labor!</p>

<p>You feel the doom falling, and strive to put it off.
Not because God has made woman of a diviner
nature; not because he has made her more precious,
to be kept from the rough handling of the world,&mdash;does
it shrink from her pure gaze. No; but because
God himself, in balancing the world's forces, has
blended her moral nature with her mental, purposely
to check her brother's aggressiveness, and moderate
his lust of gain. So has he given to man a cooler
temper, a grander deliberateness, a strength equal to
every strain, which shall repair the fault of her warm
impulses, her "nimble" action, her unfitness, casual
or universal, for long-sustained effort. But what can
either of you do alone? Impulse, tenderness, and
moral promptings, grow into tawdry sentimentalism,
when shut out from their fit arena, when untrained to
emulate a brother's active life. Coolness, forethought,
and strength grow into cunning, rapacity, and tyranny,
when uninfluenced by that gentler element of your
nature which God has placed by your side. Helps-meet
for each other you were ordained: why hinder
and obstruct each other's pathway?</p>

<p>From this moment, put aside ignoble jealousy, inert
sympathy, and stupid indifference to your own moral
position. Only by heartily accepting the sweet juices
and flavors of her life can you secure fragrant blossoms
and precious fruit to your own. The words are just
as true when I turn to counsel her. If ever this earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
grows liker heaven, it will be when the broad and
generous sympathies prophesied by this new movement
take practical shape, and there are&mdash;</p>

<p>I have often spoken, not only in this lecture, but in
almost every one I have ever given, of the great need
of conscientious, painstaking woman's work. During
the last year, Baron T&#339;rmer has been borne by torch-light
to his last home, and the mediæval artist has been
mourned as a personal friend by many a crowned
head. The torches of the priests who bore him to
his grave very likely startled to the window our two
young countrywomen, who are pursuing sculpture in
the Eternal City. Little did they guess, that, in the
city of Florence, there was living at that moment a
woman as able, as renowned, though, for certain
reasons, not so well known to them, as the great artist
just departed. I will close this lecture with a brief
sketch of Félicie de Fauveau, for whose woman's
work no apology will ever need to be made.</p>

<p>Entering Florence by the Porta Romana, you find,
in the Via della Fornace, a dark-green door, which
opens in to a paved court, once the entrance to a
convent. Beyond stretches a cool, quiet garden; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
all manner of birdcages and dovecotes remind you of
Rosa Bonheur's fondness for pets. Through that
quiet garden, hedged with laurel and cypress, you
might have walked, but a little time ago, with a
shrewd, sagacious, life-loving French woman, an aristocrat
and a Legitimist, whose eyes had looked upon
the guillotine, and who was proud of having suffered
for her faith and country. She would lead you to her
small parlor, furnished with ancient hangings, carved
chairs, and gold-grounded Pre-Raphaelite pictures of
great value. Here she would introduce you to her
daughter, Félicie de Fauveau.</p>

<p>A forehead low and broad; soft, brown eyes; an
aquiline nose; a well-cut, well-closed mouth; a flexible,
fine figure; a velvet skirt and jacket of the color
of the "dead leaf;" a velvet cap of the same, drawn
over blonde hair, cut square across the forehead, as in
the picture of Faust,&mdash;this is what you see when you
look at the artist; this is what Ary Scheffer painted
and valued so, that no gold would buy the portrait
while he lived. Fire, air, and water are in that organization:
the movements of the arms are angular;
but the hands are soft, white, fine, and royal.</p>

<p>Born in Tuscany, she was early carried to Paris;
whence she removed, when very young, to Limoux,
Bayonne, and Besançon. A great taste for music
and painting she inherited from her mother. Her
studies were profound, and among them she pursued
archæology and heraldry. At Besançon she painted
in oils, but was not satisfied; and from the workmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
who carved for the churches she got her first hint
towards modelling. When her father died, she was
ready to devote herself to the support of her family.
When people told her it was unbecoming, she drew
herself up: "Are you ignorant," she asked, "that an
artist is a gentlewoman?"</p>

<p>Benvenuto Cellini was her prototype; and to her
may be attributed that revival of a taste for mediæval
art which, proceeding from Paris, has had, of late
years, so great an influence on England.</p>

<p>Her first work was a group called "The Abbot."
Encouraged by unlimited praise, she made a basso-relievo,&mdash;containing
six figures, and representing
Christina of Sweden in the fatal galley with Monaldeschi.
This was in the last "Exposition des Beaux
Arts," and received the gold medal from Charles X.
in person.</p>

<p>Up to 1830, the young girl remained in Paris. Her
mother was so accomplished, Félicie herself so witty
and profound a talker, that a distinguished circle
gathered round them; among them, Scheffer, Delaroche,
Giraud. All manner of fine artistic experiments
in modelling and drawing were improvised about
their study-table. There she executed for Count
Pourtalès a bronze lamp of singular beauty. A
bivouac of archangels, armed as knights, were represented
as resting round a watch-fire, where St.
Michael stood sentinel; round the lamp, in golden
letters, <em>Vaillant, veillant</em>,&mdash;"Brave, but cautious;"
beneath, a stork's foot holds a pebble surrounded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
beautiful aquatic plants. Many models were lost on
the breaking-up of her Paris studio. She was incessantly
occupied with commissions for private galleries;
she was to have modelled two doors for the
Louvre, and to have superintended the decoration of
a baptistery,&mdash;when the Revolution broke up her
calm and studious life. With the celebrated daughter
of the Duras Family, she retired to La Vendée,
and, virtuous and honored, made herself as active,
politically, as the reckless women of the Fronde. To
this day, the peasantry know her as the Demoiselle.
For those who remember her, there will never be
another. Finally came pursuit and capture. After a
long search, the two women were dragged from the
mouth of an oven. Félicie assisted her companion to
escape; was watched more closely in consequence,
and remained seven months in prison at Angers. In
prison she designed a group representing the duel of
the Lord of Jarnac before Henry II., and a monument
to Louis de Bonnechose. At the close of the seven
months, she returned to her studio at Paris. But
very soon the appearance of the Duchesse de Berri in
La Vendée restored hope to all Royalist hearts, and
Félicie rushed to her side.</p>

<p>"My opinions are dearer to me than my art," she
said, and proved it by heroic sacrifices. On the failure
of this second attempt, she was exiled by the government.
In the very teeth of the authorities, she
returned to Paris, broke up her studio, and joined her
mother in Florence, where they have ever since resided,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
clad, not without significance, in colors of the
fallen leaf. No one but an artist can guess what loss
is involved in the sudden and forcible breaking-up of
an old studio. At the very moment when Félicie and
her mother were all but starving in Florence, a man in
Paris made an almost fabulous fortune by selling
walking-sticks made from designs which she had
sketched during the happy evenings of her girlhood.
The Fauveaus would not accept a dollar from the
party they had served; and Madame had as much
pride as her daughter in establishing the new studio.
Félicie wrote, "We have manna, but only on condition
that we save none for the morrow."</p>

<p>In her studio you find no Pagan traces, only Christian
art,&mdash;St. Dorothea lifting her lovely hands for the
basket of fruit an angel brings; a Santa Reparata,
perfect in terra-cotta; exquisite mirror-frames of wood,
bronze, and silver. She has executed for Count
Zichy an Hungarian costume, a collar, belt, sword, and
spurs, of finest work. The Empress of Russia has
ordered from her a silver bell. It is decorated by
twenty figures, the servants of a mediæval household;
who assemble at the call of three stewards,
whose figures form the handle. Round the bell is
blazoned, in Gothic letters,&mdash;</p>

  <span class="i0">"De bon vouloir servir le maître."</span><br />
  <span class="i0">"With good will to serve the master."</span><br />
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Beside the crowded labors of twenty-five years,
Félicie has studied the merely mechanical portions of
her art, and tried to discover some old artistic secrets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
To cast a statue whole, so as to require no after-touch
of the chisel, has been her lifelong endeavor.
She finally succeeded in her St. Michael, though not
till it had been recast seven times. It is probable her
experiments led the way for those by which Crawford
succeeded in casting his Beethoven. I cannot tell
how many of you have heard of Félicie de Fauveau.
The fact that her works are chiefly in private galleries
and her own studio, screens her from observation.
The higher dignitaries of the church and the princes
of art are almost her only companions. She works
constantly. About a year since, the death of her devoted
mother drew the veil still closer round her daily
life; but I retrace her story with honorable pride.</p>

<p>Félicie de Fauveau is not merely an artist. She is
the first artist in the world, in her peculiar walk. As
a worker in jewels, bronze, gold, and silver, as a designer
of monuments and mediæval furniture, she
stands without approach.</p>

<h2>III.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>"THE OPENING OF THE GATES."</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>"If such a day never come, then I perceive much else will never come;
heroic purity of heart and of eye, noble, pious valor to amend <em>us and the
age of bronze and lacquer</em>,&mdash;how can they ever come?"&mdash;<span class="smcap">T. Carlyle.</span></p></blockquote>


<p class="dropcap">"TO destroy daughters is to make war upon
Heaven's harmony. The more daughters you
drown, the more daughters you will have; and never
was it known that the drowning of daughters led to
the birth of sons."</p>

<p>This passage from the treatise of Kwei Chunk Fu
upon Infanticide may be translated so as to apply
to every Christian nation. The Chinese are not
the only people who drown daughters. England,
France, and America, the three leading intelligences
of the world, are busy at it this moment. The cold,
pure wave of the Pacific is a sweeter draught than
that social flood of corruption and depression which,
like a hideous quicksand, buries your sisters out of
your sight. "The more daughters you drown, the
more daughters you will have." Most certainly; and
if, instead of the word "daughters," you insert the
words "weak and useless members of society,"&mdash;which
is what the Chinese mean by it,&mdash;you will see
that Kwei Fu is right. Let women starve; let them
sink into untold depths of horror, without one effort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
to save them; and, for every woman so lost, two
shall be born to inherit her fate.</p>

<p>Nor need the careless and ignorant man of wealth
fancy that his own daughters shall escape while he
continues heartlessly indifferent, though he never actively
wronged a human creature. When the spoiler
is abroad, he does not pause to choose his victims.
The fairest and most innocent may be the first struck
down; for human passions find their fitting type in
the persecuted beast of the forest. It is not the hunter
alone who feels his teeth and talons, but the first
human flesh his lawless members seize.</p>

<p>If these things are so, surely it is our duty to consider
well this question of work, to suggest all possible
modes of relief, and, while waiting for the final application
of absolute principles, to help society forward
by all partial measures of amelioration; for only
partial can they be, so long as the present modes of
thought and feeling continue. How little any one
person can contribute toward the solution of our difficulties,
I am well aware; yet I venture to make a
few suggestions.</p>

<p>The "Edinburgh Review," whether prepared to
recommend female preachers and lecturers or not, <em>does</em>
propose women as teachers of Oratory; and says distinctly,
that, for this purpose, they are to be preferred
to men, as their voices are more penetrating, distinct,
delicate, and correct than those of men. I think it
was a matter of surprise to American audiences, when
women first came forward as public speakers, that, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
so large a number of cases, the parlor <em>tone</em> would
reach to the extremity of a large hall. Women, too,
were heard at a disadvantage, because popular curiosity
compelled them to speak in the largest buildings.
There are a great many women, and there are also a
great many men, whose voices are wholly unfit for
public exigencies; but, when you consider that women
have been wholly untrained so far, how great do their
natural advantages appear! Several female teachers
of elocution in our midst prove that this is gradually
perceived. These remarks should be extended so as
to cover all instruction in the pronunciation of languages.
There may be men capable of distinguishing
the delicate shades of sound, so that a woman's voice
can catch them; but such men are rare exceptions to
the common incompetency. The French nasals cannot
be distinguished accurately by a man's voice: the
bass tone is too broad, and the treble wavers in trying
to find the middle rest. Pursue the study of Italian
for years with the best teacher that Boston can furnish;
and, when you first hear a cultivated Italian
woman speak, you will find that you have the whole
thing to learn over again. So there was never any
teacher of the French language equal to Rachel,
whose nimble and fiery tongue never dropped an unmeaning
accent nor tone; nor of the English like
Fanny Kemble, who, despite certain "stage tricks," in
vogue since the days of Garrick, shows us what delicate
shades of meaning lie hidden in the vowel
sounds, and what power a slight variation of a flexible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
voice confers upon a dull passage. The teaching of
oratory and of language, then, should devolve upon
woman.</p>

<p>"Why," asks Ernest Legouvé,&mdash;"why should not
the immense variety of bureaucrative and administrative
employments be given up to women?" Under
this head would come the business inspection of
hospitals, barracks, prisons, factories, and the like;
and the decision of many sanitary questions. For all
this, woman is far fitter than man. Her eye is quick;
her common sense ready: she sees the consequence in
the cause, and does not need to argue every disputed
point. A shingle missing from the roof is a trifle to
a man; but, the moment a woman sees it, her glance
takes in the stained walls, the dripping curtains, wet
carpets, sympathetic ceilings, damp beds, and very
possibly the colds and illness, which this trifle involves.
For this reason, she is a far fitter inspector
of all small abuses than man.</p>

<p>Consider, then, Legouvé's proposition. The proprietor
of the London Adelphi advertised, at the
opening of the last season, that his box-openers, check-takers,
and so on, would all be women. Throughout
the whole range of public amusements, there is a
wide field for the employment of girls, which this
single step has thrown open.</p>

<p>Women are so steadily pressing in to the medical
profession, that I have no need to direct your attention
toward it; but I may say, that it is much to be
wished that women should devote themselves to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
specialities of that science. Until within a very few
years, a Boston physician has been expected to understand
all the ills that flesh is heir to; an eye-doctor
or an ear-doctor or a lung-doctor must necessarily be
a quack. Women are entering, in medicine, a very
wide field. A few specially gifted may master every
branch of practice; but many will undoubtedly fail,
from the want of <em>inherited</em> habits of hard study, of
<em>transmitted</em> power of investigation. I wish those who
are in danger of this would apply strenuously to one
branch of practice; and a great success in any one
direction would do more for the general cause than a
thousand competences earned by an ordinary career.</p>

<p>I do not suppose there is a city in the United
States,&mdash;and, if not in the United States, then certainly
not in the world,&mdash;where, if you asked the
name of the first physician, you would be answered
by that of a woman.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> I do not complain of this: it
is too soon to expect it. Colleges, schools of anatomy,
clinical courses, have not yet been thrown open; and
success, so far, has been mastered mainly by original
endowment. Genius has held the torch, and shown
the way; but I want women to remember, that, in
this department, all the teachings of nature and experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
show that they are bound to excel men. Let
them, therefore, take the best way to accomplish it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>At the School of Design in New York, the other
day, I pressed upon the observation of the young
wood-engravers the possibility of opening for themselves
a new career by wood-carving. It is quite
common, in old European museums, to see the stones
of plums and peaches delicately carved by woman's
hand, and set in frames of gold and jewels. Sometimes
they are the work of departed saints or cloistered
nuns; and a terrible waste of time they seem to our
modern eyes. Properzia dei Rossi,&mdash;whose early
history is so obscure, that no one knows the name of
her parents; while the cities of Bologna and Modena
still dispute the honor of her birth,&mdash;Properzia began
her wonderful career by carving on peach-stones.
One she decorated with thirty sacred figures, holding
the stone so near the eye as to gain a microscopic
power. On one still in the possession of the Grassi
Family, at Bologna, she chiselled the passion of our
Lord; where twelve figures, gracefully disposed, are
said to glow with characteristic expression. Properzia
died a maiden, according to Vasari and the best
manuscript contemporaneous authority; and there
seems to be no ground for the vile stories that have
clustered round her name, other than the fact, that in
her sculpture of Potiphar's wife, finished when she
knew that she was dying, she ventured to cut her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
own likeness. It is not to the carving of cherry-stones,
however, that I would direct the attention of
young women, but to the Swiss carving of paper-knives,
bread-plates, salad-spoons, ornamental figures,
jewel-boxes, and so on. On account of the care
required in transportation, these articles bring large
prices; and I feel quite sure that many an idle girl
might win a pleasant fame through such trifles. No
one will dispute the assertion, who recalls the pranks
of her young classmates at school. Do you remember
the exquisite drawings which once decorated the
kerchiefs, the linen collars and sleeves, of a certain
schoolroom? The sun of the artist set early; but I
have often thought that a free maiden career in the
higher walks of art might have preserved her to us.
The same fancy, displayed in wood-carving, would
have challenged the attention of the world; and the
cherry-stones also bore witness to her power. The
only practical difficulty would spring from the want
of highly seasoned wood; and that could be obviated
by a little patience. Should any young girl be tempted
by my words into this career, I hope she will not give
away her carvings to indifferent friends, but carry
them into the market at once, and let them bring
their price, that she may know her own value, and
that of the work.</p>

<p>Properzia also excelled in engraving: so did Elizabetta
Sirani in 1660. Her engravings from Guido are
still considered master-pieces. We have female engravers
on wood and steel, and also female lithographers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
I want some woman to apply herself to this work,
with such energy and determination as will place her
at the head of it. Let her do this, and she could
soon establish a workshop, and take men and women
into her employ; standing responsible herself for the
finish of every piece of work marked with her name.
Let some idle woman of wealth offer the capital for
such an experiment, and share some of its administrative
duties. "Success" is the best argument. It
would be possible to organize in Boston, at this moment,
a shop of the best kind, where all the designing
and engraving should be done by women. Why can
it not be tried? Carvers on wood, and engravers then.</p>

<p>I have known several English barbers,&mdash;not women
of the decorative art, like our sainted Harriet Ryan;
but women actually capable of shaving a man!
Why, then, does the "Englishwoman's Journal" inform
us, that, in Normandy and Western Africa,
there actually are female barbers?</p>

<p>I think there is room in Boston for an establishment
of this kind; a place from which a woman
could come to a sick-room to shave the heated head
or cut the beard of the dying; a place where women's
and children's wants could be attended to without
necessary contact with men; and with the absolutely
necessary cleanliness, of which there is not now a
single instance in this city.</p>

<p>When I mentioned wood-carving to women, I was
thinking, in part, of the immense annual demand for
Christmas presents. In this connection, also, I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
like to direct the attention of our rural women to the
art of preserving and candying fruit. "But that is
nothing new," you will say. "Did not your Massachusetts
census for 1845 enumerate certain picklers
and preservers?" Yes; but those women were merely
in the employ of men carrying on large establishments.
What I would suggest is a domestic manufacture to
compete with French candies, and to occupy the
minds of our farmers' wives and daughters, to the exclusion
of shirt-fronts and shoe-binding.</p>

<p>Every one of us, probably, fills more than one
little stocking, on Christmas night, with candied fruit.
If we belong to the "first families," and wish to do
the thing handsomely, this fruit has cost from seventy-five
cents to a dollar a pound; we knowing, all the
while, that better could be produced for half or two-thirds
the money. Last year, I purchased one pound
of the candy, and examined it with practical reference
to this question. Plums, peaches, cherries, apples,
and pears, all tasted alike, and had evidently been
boiled in the same sirup. Apple and quince marmalades
alone had any flavor. Now, our farmers' daughters
could cook these fruits so as to preserve their
flavor, could candy them and pack them into boxes,
quite as well as the French <em>men</em>; and so a new and
important domestic industry might arise. The experiment
would be largely profitable as soon as all risk of
mistake were over; and perishable fruit at a distance
from market could be used in this way. A few
years ago, we had a rare conserve from Constantinople<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
and Smyrna, called fig-paste. Now we have a mixture
of gum Arabic and flour, flavored with essences;
made for the most part at Westboro', and called by
the same name. Yes, we actually have fig-paste,
spicy with wintergreen and black-birch! Now, what
is to prevent our farmers' daughters from making
this?&mdash;from putting up fruits in air-tight cans, and
drying a great many kinds of vegetables that cannot
be had now for love or money? Who can get Lima
beans or dried sweet-corn, that does not dry them
from his own garden?</p>

<p>Do not let our medical friends feel too indignant if
I recommend to these same women the manufacture
of pickles. The use of pickles, like the use of wine,
may be a questionable thing; but, like liquors, they
are a large article of trade: and, if we must have
them, why not have them made of wholesome fruit,
in good cider-vinegar, with a touch of the grandmotherly
seasoning that we all remember, rather than
of stinted gherkins, soured by vitriol and greened by
copper? There are many sweet sauces, too,&mdash;made
of fruit, stewed with vinegar, spice, and sugar,&mdash;which
cannot be obtained in shops, and would meet a
good market. How easy the whole matter is, may be
guessed from this fact, that, sitting once at a Southern
table,&mdash;the table of a genial grand-nephew of George
Washington, who bore his name,&mdash;I was offered
twenty-five kinds of candied fruit, all made by the
delicate hands of his wife; and seven varieties in
form and flavor, from the common tomato.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>I looked through Boston in vain, the other day, to
find a common dish-mop large enough to serve my
purpose. There was no such thing to be found.
Taking up one of the slender tassels offered me, I
inquired into its history, and was informed that it
was imported from France. The one I had been trying
to replace had been made by some skilful Yankee
hand for a Ladies' Fair. Now, what are our poor
women doing, that they cannot compete with this
French trumpery, and give us at least dish-mops fit
for use?</p>

<p>As teachers of gymnastics, women are already
somewhat employed. A wide field would be opened,
if a teacher were attached to each of our public
schools,&mdash;a step in physical education greatly needed.</p>

<p>No conservative is so prejudiced, I suppose, as to
object to placing woman in all positions of moral
supervision. Female assistants in jails, prisons, workhouses,
insane asylums, and hospitals, are seen to be
fit, and to have a harmonizing influence in every respect.
How many more such assistants are needed,
we may guess from the fact that our City Jail and
Charlestown are still unsupplied. Women of a superior
order are needed for such posts; and when will
they be found? Not till labor is thoroughly respected;
not till the popular voice says, "It is all
very well to be a Miss Dix, and go from asylum to
asylum, suggesting and improving; but it is just <em>as</em>
well, quite <em>as</em> honorable, to work in <em>one</em> asylum, carrying
out the wise ideas which a Miss Dix suggests,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
and securing the faithful trial of her experiments."
Many men in Beacon Street would feel honored to
call the moving philanthropist sister or friend; but
few would like to acknowledge a daughter in the
post of matron or superintendent. Why not? There
is something "rotten in the State" where such inconsistencies
exist. How thoroughly men accept such
women, as soon as they are permitted to try their experiment,
we may judge from the case of Florence
Nightingale and her staff. The very men, whose
scepticism kept the army suffering for months, would
be the first to send them now; and the soldiers, who
kissed her shadow where it fell, would fill the whole
Commissariat with women. When her gentle but
efficient hand broke in the doors of the storehouses at
Scutari, a general huzza followed from the very men
who were too timid to break the trammels of office.
The woman's keen sympathy with the advancing
spirit of her time, taught her what it was fit to do;
and, if the rippling smiles of suffering men had not
rewarded her when the bedding and stores were distributed,
the warm encomiums of her Queen, whose
heart she had so truly read, must have done it. Following
out this train of reflection, I have often
thought it would some day fall to women, and to
women alone, to exercise the function of parish minister!
I do not mean "parish preacher." I hold pulpit
graces cheap by the side of that fatherly walk
among his people, which has made the name of
Charles Lowell sacred to the West Church. Go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
back to the history of the first church in every town:
see how the minister knew the story of every heart in
his parish; how he kept his eye on every lonely boy
or orphan girl; how widowed mothers took his counsel
about schools and rents; how forlorn old maids
trusted to him to make all "things come round right;"
how the lad, inclining to wild courses, found no better
friend than he. How is it now? The minister
has his Sunday sermons, his annual addresses before
certain societies, his weekly association. In the old
time, such things were done, yet not the other left
undone. Now the lonely boy or orphan girl must
seek out the minister,&mdash;and how likely this is to
happen everybody knows; the mother must tell over
the story of her widowhood, pained to see how "in
course" it falls upon that wearied ear; the spinster
must tell again how the boat floated empty and bottom
upward to shore long years ago, and so no one
was "spared to keep all right;" and the wild lad&mdash;alas!
how many such do the clergy save now?</p>

<p>As I see such things,&mdash;and I do see them often,&mdash;as
I realize that change in men and times, in manners
and books, from which this change is inseparable,&mdash;I
confess I see a new<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> sphere opening for women. It
takes no remarkable gifts, in the common sense of
those words; only a kindly heart, a thoughtful head,
a tender, reverent care-taking, wholly apart from meddlesomeness.
Not many are the ministers now who <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>will pause to explain to
Martha that she is careful and troubled about many things;
and that really the visionary Mary, with her dreamy eyes,
is choosing the good part. Not many can see Nathanael standing
under the fig-tree, and remind him of it at the needful
moment. But if, in every religious household, there
were a deaconess, called by nature and God to her
work,&mdash;one to whom the young felt a right to go
with questions home could not answer; one pledged
to secret counsel, with whom the restless and unhappy
might confer,&mdash;it seems to me the wheels of
life would move more smoothly.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> How the unlikeliest
persons are sometimes raised up to such a ministry,
let the following story tell. In the dim and dreary
precincts of the Seven Dials in London, years ago,
two orphan girls were left lying on door-steps, fed by
chance charity, to grow up as they might. One died;
and the other was finally adopted by an old man, an
atheist, who had been neighbor to her parents. She
grew up an atheist also, and married,&mdash;saved by
God's mercy from what had seemed her likeliest fate.
Stepping into the passage of the Bloomsbury Mission
Hall to shelter herself from the rain, one night, a
shaft, winged by the Holy Spirit, struck to her empty
heart.</p>

<p>The next week, a lending library was to be opened
in the district. Marian was first at the door. "Sir,"
said she, "will you lend me a Bible?"&mdash;"A Bible!"
exclaimed the man. "We did not mean to <em>lend</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Bibles; but I will get you one."</p>

<p>How long she read, how she was at first moved,
none but God can know. But, whether from mental
distress or from the sad vicissitudes of her needy
career, she became very ill, and went to a public
hospital. While there, she saw the sufferings of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
who applied for its charity, and observed that the
filthy state of their persons needed a friendly female
hand. When she came out, she wrote to the missionary,
and told him she wished to dedicate all her spare
time to the lost and degraded of her own sex. "God's
mercy," she writes, "has spared me from their fate:
for me their misery will have no terrors. I will clean
and wash them, and mend their linen. If they can
get into a hospital, I will take care of their clothes."
You may suppose the missionary did not lose sight
of Marian, and you may guess how gladly she undertook
to distribute Bibles; going, where none of the
gentry could go, into dens of misery known only to
the police-officers and herself. Spending her mornings
in distributing Bibles, and giving the kind and
pastoral counsel everywhere needed, she discovered,
in the autumn of 1857, a new want, and devoted her
afternoons to teaching the ignorant women about
her to cut and make their children's clothes. Why
<em>she</em> knew better than <em>they</em>, who shall tell? Then came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the November panic and its wide-spread distresses;
and, seeing how food was wasted from ignorance, she
opened a soup-kitchen of her own. She used what is
called vegetable stock: her wretched customers liked
it, and she sold it all through the winter for a price
which just paid the cost of cooking. Her noble work
goes on. The stone which the builders of our modern
society would have rejected, is now the head of the
corner; and Seven Dials knows her as "Marian, the
Bible-woman."</p>

<p>Another mission has been begun at St. Pancras,
where, in one of the worst neighborhoods, the most
profligate men have gathered together, between church
hours, to hear a young lady read the "Pilgrim's Progress,"
and are thus softened and led to higher things.
Would you shut those sacred lips because they are a
woman's? Would you quote St. Paul to her, and
blush for her career, if she were your own daughter?
I will not believe it.</p>

<p>At the parish of St. Alkmunds, in Shrewsbury, the
wife of the clergyman, Mrs. Whitman, began by modest
reading from house to house; a work which has
since been greatly blessed. Gently she won profligate
men and women to give up their beer, and the
temptations of the "tap;" signing herself the pledge
which they alone needed.</p>

<p>A very important work could be done in this city
by the establishment of a proper Training School
for Servants. One reason why our house-work is
so miserably done is, that it is never regarded as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
a profession, in which a certain degree of excellence
must be attained, but rather as a "make-shift,"
by the aid of which a certain number of years can
be got through. The only thorough servant I ever
had was one who had been educated at such a
school in Germany. Here would be an admirable
field for some of the women who have money and
time, but no object in life. Such a school must be
carried on in connection with a good-sized boarding-house
of a respectable kind; and beside the
regular superintendents, who will, of course, be hired
for the different departments, there must be committees
of ladies who should see to the practical
working of the institution in turn. This is necessary
to secure that thorough working in every department
which the best housekeeping demands. Only
by intelligent, refined oversight can feathered "flirts"
be hindered from taking the place of the tidy dusting
cloth; only so will a girl learn to sweep each
apartment separately, without dragging her accumulations
from floor to floor; only so can soap-suds
be kept off your oil-cloths, soiled hands from your
doors, and dust from your shirt-fronts. I do not
believe a better service could be done to the community
than the establishment of such a school,
especially in relation to cooking.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> A good many
such experiments have been successfully tried in
England, but none so thorough as that I would propose
in Boston.</p>

<p>With regard to the lowest class of employed
women, such as are employed at home, we have,
it seems to me, several distinct duties to perform.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>In the first place, we need a public but self-supporting
Laundry. By this I mean two large halls, with
an adjacent area, built at the expense of the city,
and properly superintended, where, for so much an
hour, women of the lower class may wash, starch,
dry, and iron the clothes they take home. A bleaching-ground
would be desirable; but, if it could not
be had, a steam drying-room would be the next
best thing. Good starch, soap, and indigo should
be for sale upon the premises at wholesale prices;
it not being desirable that the city should make
money out of the necessities of its poor. If such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
an establishment could be had, a great many women
would be changed from paupers to decent citizens.
They are tired of seeking washing; for, in their
one close room, scented with boiling onions or rank
meat, without a proper area for drying, and compelled
to pay high prices for poor soap and starch,
they cannot do decently the very work which philanthropy
soon becomes unwilling to intrust to them,
and for which they are compelled to charge higher
than the best private laundry. The city could buy
coal, wood, soap, starch, and indigo at manufacturers'
and importers' prices, and so give them a fair
chance for competition. I hope this project, long
since partially adopted in many cities of the Old
World, may find favor with my audience.</p>

<p>There is in Boston no place, strange as it may
seem, where plain, neatly finished clothing can be
bought ready-made. I can go down town, and buy
embroidered merinos, Paris hats with ostrich feathers,
and lace-trimmed, welted linen: but if I want a plain,
cotton skirt for a child, whereof the calico was eight
cents a yard; if I want a plain, cotton print made
into a neatly fitting dress; if I want a boy's coarse
apron,&mdash;such things are not to be had, or only so
very badly made that no one will buy them. I do
not want lace or embroidery or silk, or fine linen;
but I do want my button-holes nicely turned and
strong, my hems even, my gathers stroked, and, however
plain and coarse, the whole finish of the garment
such as a mistress of the needle only would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
approve, such as no lady need be ashamed to wear.
So do others. The reasons given to explain the
non-existence of such a magazine in Boston are,
first, That our women of the middle class are, for
the most part, accustomed to cut and make their
own clothes; second, That there is a prevalent but
mistaken idea, that clothes made for sale cannot
possibly fit. With regard to the first point, it may
be said, that, as more and more avenues of labor
are opened for women, this class perceives that it is
not good economy for them to do their own sewing.
Hands compelled to coarser or heavier labor cannot
sew quick or well, and those training to more delicate
manipulation lose practice by returning to it;
so there will be a constantly increasing class of
purchasers.</p>

<p>As to the impossibility of fitting, that is a vulgar
mistake. The human frame is quite as much the
result of law as Mr. Buckle's statistics. Any comely,
healthy form is a good model for all other forms of
the same height and breadth. Who ever heard of a
French bonnet or a bridal trousseau that did not
fit? yet these things are made by arbitrary rules.
Our superintendent could find every measure she
would ever need in one of the teeming houses on
Sea Street. She must take her measures from life,
not books. Nor would I have the sewing done with
machines, unless those of the highest cost could be
procured and ably superintended. The best machine
is as yet a poor substitute for the supple, human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
hand; and many practical inconveniences must result
from its use. It requires more skill and intelligence
to manage man's simplest machine, than to
control with a thought that complicated network
of nerve, bone, and fibre which we have been accustomed
to use.</p>

<p>Capital to start such an establishment as I refer to
is all that is needed. How desirable the thing is, you
can easily see. In the first place, if good common
clothing could be so purchased, mothers need not keep
a large stock on hand: an accident could be readily
repaired. In the second, it would greatly simplify and
expedite many a charitable task. The terrible suffering
which followed the panic of November, 1857, you
all remember. Purses, always open hitherto, were
necessarily closed; no Sister of Charity was willing
to tread on the heels of the sheriff: yet the need was
greater than ever. Many persons who had dismissed
their servants were found willing to give a rough,
untrained girl her board; but who was to provide her
with decent clothes? They could not be bought, and to
make them was the work of time and strength. May
I always remember to honor, as God will always surely
bless, one woman possessed of wealth and beauty,
who did clothe from head to foot with her own needle,
in that dreadful winter, <em>three</em> "wild Irish girls,"
and took them successively into her own family; training
them to habits of tolerable decency, until others,
less self-sacrificing, were found ready to do their
part!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>No people in our community suffer such inconvenience,
loss, and imposition, in having their clothes
made, as our servant girls. If a plentiful supply of
calico sacks and skirts or loose dresses could be anywhere
found, few girls would ever employ a dressmaker.</p>

<p>I have spoken of Public Laundry Rooms, and a
Ready-made Clothing Room. There is a class of
women greatly to be benefited by the establishment
of a Knitting Factory. It is well known to every
person in this room, especially to physicians, that no
knitting done by machinery can compete with that
done by the human hand, in durability, warmth, or
stimulative power. Invalids are now obliged to import
the Shetland jackets, which are always badly
shaped; or to hire, at our fancy stores, the making of
delicate and very expensive fabrics. Men's socks and
children's gloves may be purchased; but the first cost
from seventy-five cents to a dollar a pair, and the last
are of very inferior manufacture. We cannot give
out knitting to advantage, because of the dirt and
grease it is liable to accumulate where water is not
plenty nor ventilation to be had; and very good knitters
of socks have not skill and intelligence to manage
the different sizes, or to shape the larger articles,
such as drawers and under-jackets for the two sexes.
Coarse crocheting would answer better than knitting
for many articles.</p>

<p>Let a large, airy room be hired, well supplied with
Cochituate. Let all sorts of material be kept on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
hand, and some coarse, warm kinds of Shetland yarn
imported that are not now to be had. Let at least
two superintendents be appointed from among the
women, who work <em>best</em> for our fancy stores; let
knitting-women be invited to use this room for
twelve hours a day, or less, as they choose,&mdash;receiving
daily pay for their daily needs; and in less than
one year you would have an establishment, for which
not merely Boston, but all New England, would be
grateful. I should hope that neither this nor the
Clothing Room would ever offer very expensive or
highly ornamental articles for sale. There is no danger
that the interests of the wealthy will suffer.
What I desire is to provide for the needs of the lowest
women and the comfort of the middle-class customer.</p>

<p>The young girls in Beacon Street have now some
thing to do. I offer them the establishment of a
Training School for Servants, of a public but self-supporting
Laundry, of a Ready-made Clothes Room,
and a Knitting Factory; all simple matters, entirely
within their control, if they would but believe it.</p>

<p>A certain human faithlessness often interferes with
the execution of such plans. If my young friends
doubt, let them go and talk to Harriet Ryan about it.
She will show them, how, having taken the first step
toward duty, God always leads the way to the second.
To cheer them still further, I will tell them&mdash;for
I may never have a fitter opportunity&mdash;of the
splendid success of the industrial schools in Ireland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
established in 1850 by Ellen Woodlock,&mdash;a name
destined to stand honorably by the side of Florence
Nightingale; nay, worthy to precede it, in so far as
preventive measures are always a greater good than
remedial. Mrs. Ellen Woodlock has powers of statement,
according to the "London Times," equal to her
extraordinary powers of execution; and it is from
her own account of the work that I select what I
have to offer you.</p>

<p>In 1850, Mrs. Woodlock had placed her only child
at school, and began to look for something to do. A
lady, who had started an industrial school on a gift of
$250 from a clergyman, asked for her help. She proposed
to teach young girls to do plain sewing. Very
soon, there were more seamstresses than customers;
but God did not fail to open a way. One poor, half-blind
creature&mdash;very poor and very earnest&mdash;failed
in the plain sewing, and was put to make cabbage
nets. She did it so well, that Mrs. Woodlock taught
her to make silk nets for the hair. The nets took:
other girls were taught; and Mrs. Woodlock went to
all the shops in Cork, and coaxed the merchants
to buy of her. She very soon began to make nets
for exportation. Mrs. Woodlock's fashionable niece
arrived from Dublin, with a new style of crocheted
net. Her aunt had a dozen made directly; and, by
showing these, got orders from all the merchants
for the new style. One day, a merchant came into
the school, and saw a little girl at work on a mohair
net. He asked the price, and found that she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
make him twelve for the same money that he had
paid for one in London. So you may guess where
his next orders went.</p>

<p>Mrs. Woodlock then made interest with the "buyers,"
or young men who go to London twice a year to
purchase goods. They took over her patterns, and
returned with orders so large that their principals at
once entered into the business. Yellow nets were
made for Germany. Many were sent to England
and America; and orders came so thick that they
had to share them with the convent schools. They
paid out a hundred dollars weekly; and alacrity and
intelligence beamed where there had been, at first,
only hopeless suffering and imbecility. Of course,
this point was not reached without much self-sacrifice.
At first, the children made awkward work that
would not sell. Then the lady patronesses got tired,
and dropped off. Worn and worried, Mrs. Woodlock
fell ill. If you ever undertake any of the schemes I
have mentioned, you must be prepared for all these
things: they will certainly happen. No one ever fought
a revolutionary war, and established an independence,
without one or two defeats like that at Bunker Hill.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
When they become historic, we call them victories.
When Mrs. Woodlock found that she was human and
liable to fall ill, she sent for some of the Sisters of
Charity, and trained several, so that they could, on an
emergency, fill her place well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>But Mrs. Woodlock did not stop here. She used to
teach the Catechism in the parish church; and, one
day, she gave notice that a new school would be
opened in that neighborhood. The next morning,
one hundred and fifty girls, between the ages of fifteen
and twenty-five, presented themselves. Mrs.
Woodlock asked every girl, who had ever earned any
money before, to hold up her hand. Four girls did
so. They had sold apples in the streets. One hundred
and forty-six suffering creatures, who had no
way to earn a cent! Think what a class it was! Do
you remember what I told you, the other day, of
eighteen hundred and eighty women in New York
who had never been taught to support themselves?
Ten of the best workers from the first school were
taken to teach these girls; and, for a salary, the
teacher received the first <em>perfect</em> dozen of nets made
by each of her pupils. This plan was not costly, and
worked well. There was no lack of faithfulness.
Travellers came to see the schools. There was no
time wasted in looking for orders: they had more
than they could fill. Of course, they must keep these
hands employed: so other manufactures must be
tried. Mrs. Woodlock thought she would try fine shirt-fronts
for the city dealers. What do you think the
people said? That it could not be done in all Ireland;
that there was nobody to wash and iron them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
properly; that they would have to be sent all the way
to Glasgow to be boxed in card boxes! Well, the
nuns undertook the first washing and ironing,&mdash;making
apprentices, let us hope, of some of the older
pupils; and Mrs. Woodlock found a starving band-box
maker, whom she herself taught to make flat boxes.
And look now at the blessing which always follows
wise work. This flat-box maker has had to take apprentices,
has opened another branch of her business in
Limerick, and has put money into the Savings' Bank.</p>

<p>Mrs. Woodlock's account of her work would be a
great help to any young persons engaged in philanthropic
effort. She lays the very greatest stress upon
her machinery,&mdash;her methods. Every industrial work
ought to support itself: if it does not, it is a failure.
All her schools earn their own bread, <em>in every sense</em>;
and all reforming agencies must always stand second
to any institution which does that. See how she carried
this thought into her daily life. Mrs. Woodlock
had a brother who was one of the Board of Poor-Law
Guardians. Seeing the success of her work, he persuaded
the other members to employ an embroidery
mistress in the Union School for a few months.</p>

<p>When these children knew enough, Mrs. Woodlock
took out six, and put them into her industrial school,
till she was sure they could support themselves.
Then she let them look up lodgings, and continued
to give them work from the school. In a few weeks,
they got on so well that they began to take their relations
and friends out of that terrible poorhouse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Three young girls took out their mother and cousin,
and supported them. Eighty girls were brought off
the parish by the first working of her schools. A
house has also been opened for orphans, where they
are trained to support themselves.</p>

<p>Now, my friends, the census, at the end of ten
years, will report a great change in the industrial
condition of Ireland; and the beginning of that
change was Mrs. Woodlock's intelligent moral effort
to benefit her countrywomen,&mdash;in the first place, to
teach one little sufferer to make cabbage-nets. That
element will enter into the statistics on which Mr.
Buckle bids you so confidently rely. Do not believe
him when he says that <em>moral</em> effort can never help
anybody but yourself, because it will be balanced, in
the long-run, by your neighbor's <em>immoral</em> effort. Two
and two make four in all statistics, and always will
while the world stands; but two and two and one
make five, and not four, as he asserts; and the one
which he forgets to enumerate is no other than the
divine Centre of life and action,&mdash;God himself. I
value Mr. Buckle's book. I see how clearly he
thinks; how much he has read; and how much truer
his historical attitude than any ever before assumed.
But when a man separates goodness from knowledge;
tells you that intelligence may reign alone; does not
see that the two are now and for ever one, equal
attributes of the divine nature,&mdash;then he makes a
mistake which saps the very foundation of his own
work, and writes fallacy on every page.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>What he says is perfectly true of <em>mistaken, ignorant</em>
moral effort. That does help yourself, and does <em>not</em>
help anybody else. It helps you, because it develops
your right-mindedness,&mdash;your generosity. It does
not help anybody else. It <em>hinders</em> others who are
clearer intellectually: they see and despise the mistakes,
and are not inspired by the purpose. Had it
been intelligent, they would have seen it to be divine.</p>

<p>Mrs. Woodlock's work was both intelligent and
moral. What inspired the pupils was her moral force
and disinterested love. They saw this, and were kindled
by it; while the community at large respected the
intelligence and common sense with which she laid
her plans. Intelligence made these plans self-supporting;
intelligence gave them solid pyramidal position
in the world: but moral energy gave them their
prestige, and will win its way by the side of intelligence
into the very columns which Mr. Buckle's
closing volume must quote.</p>

<p>Do not be disheartened, then, as to the ultimate
profit to others of any kindly work you feel inclined
to do. Let kindliness inspire, let intelligence direct,
your efforts. God has made your success certain
from the very foundations of the world.</p>

<p>I cannot close such inadequate survey of this field
as I have felt it my duty to offer, without alluding to
one other fact, and making one parting suggestion.
It cannot but be realized, by all the women to whom
I speak, how very casual is the communication
between the laboring class in this community and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
their employers. Suppose a housekeeper wants additional
service, how can she secure it? If she is not
wealthy enough to hire regularly, her "chance" is a
very poor one; and she must take the recommendation,
in nine cases out of ten, of some one in the
charwoman's own rank of life.</p>

<p>Suppose a maid of all work leaves a mistress alone
early some busy Monday morning, where can her
place be filled? How can any one be found who
will work by the hour or the day, in a cleanly, respectable
manner, till a new servant can be deliberately
chosen? Nobody knows of a washerwoman who is
out of work on Monday. The intelligence offices
hold no women so distressed that they will go out for
less than a week, and that on trial. Yet, somewhere
in the city, there must be women pining and longing
for that waiting work.</p>

<p>Suppose a sudden influx of visitors exhausts your
household staff, and makes a waiting-maid a necessity
where none was kept before; suppose a large group
of relatives, passing quickly through the city, come
for a plain family dinner at a moment when your personal
superintendence is impossible,&mdash;where is the
active, tidy girl who can be summoned, or the decent
woman of experience who can order matters in your
kitchen as well as you can yourself?</p>

<p>Somewhere they sit waiting&mdash;suffering, it may be&mdash;for
the opportunity which never comes. The intelligence
office will get them places; but places they
are not at liberty to seek. They need what they call
"a chance lift."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>I am well aware that wealthy and long-established
families may not suffer much from this cause. Old
servants well married, or a variety of well-paid servants
with wide connections in the neighborhood, or
deserving objects of charity personally met and understood,
often prevent such persons from feeling any
inconvenience; but for young housekeepers, for new
residents, for persons of small means and few connections,
there is no help.</p>

<p>I need not enlarge on the subject. There is no
kind of female labor of which it is easy to get a
prompt and suitable supply. To obviate this difficulty,
I think there should be a sort of "Labor
Exchange;" and this is a project which all classes
would be glad to have carried out. How shall it be
done? That, of course, must be settled by those who
have the task in charge; but, to explain what I mean,
I will offer a few suggestions. In the first place,
What are the defects in the intelligence-offices now in
existence?<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> There are several. They take cognizance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>of domestic servants alone. They are kept by
ignorant or inexperienced persons, who often lose
sight of the interests of both the employer and the
employed in their own pecuniary loss or gain. These
persons have necessarily little insight into character,
and do not see how to bring the right persons together.
They will send a slow, dawdling girl to an impatient,
lively mistress;&mdash;a smart upstart to some meek, little
wife, who has hardly learned the way to order her own
house; and the natural misunderstandings will occur.
Then the books of the office are irregularly kept, and
closed to the applicant, so that you have no chance to
select for yourself. Go down to an office, and ask for
a servant; tell the keeper not to send a raw girl, not
to send one without a recommendation, not to send a
foreigner who cannot speak English; and go home.
The odds are, that, while you are taking off your
bonnet, there will be three rings at the bell. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
first girl will be a barefooted imp of Erin, just from
the steerage. Some one at the office has been watching
three days for just such a hand to be broken into
a farm-kitchen. The second wears a flower-garden
on her head, more flounces than you do, and has, of
course, no recommendation. Some soda-room wants
her; but you do not. The third is high Dutch, and,
when you ask her for the coal-hod, brings you, in her
despair, the bread-tray. Neither of these three is
what you ordered or wanted.</p>

<p>Do you ask me the reason of this bad management,
and whether I think it can be remedied? The reason
of it is, that the superintendence of these offices is
not treated like a profession. People neither fit themselves
for it, nor are attracted to it by nature: they
simply <em>do</em> it; and how they do it we feel. They
want comprehensive insight, have no business ways,
and these difficulties are only to be obviated by bringing
a higher intelligence to bear upon the arrangements.</p>

<p>Let us have a place where all kinds of female work
can be sought and found; an intelligent working committee
first, who know what is wanted, and how to
get it, and who, most important of all, shall not be
too wise to accept diplomas from experience.</p>

<p>Let us have a committee of five; its quorum to be
three. Let these persons hire a large, clean, airy
room, and appoint an intelligent superintendent,&mdash;one
who will be interested to have the experiment
thoroughly successful. Let them line the walls, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
screen off the room with frames, having glass covers,
to lock and unlock. Let one frame be devoted to
cooks; another, to laundresses; another, to washerwomen,
window-washers, charwomen, seamstresses,
dressmakers, copyists, translators, or what you will;
and under the glass the notices should be posted.
Each should contain the name, age, and residence of
the applicant; the situation last held, and for how
long; the full address of the reference; and the date
of posting. The date should be printed and movable,
and changed semi-weekly, on the personal application
of the poster. Each woman should pay five
cents for the privilege of posting; should lose this
privilege from misconduct, from neglect to report herself,
from proved falsehood. No date should be left
unchanged more than a week, and the superintendent
should be responsible for the strict observance of the
regulations. No woman, not even a charwoman,
should be allowed to use the posting privilege, unless
she has a reference. "What!" you will say, "is that
kind?" Yes, it is kind: the want of it is doubly
cruel. A woman who needs work can afford to offer
a day's free work to get a reference; and referees
should be required to tell the simple truth. A lady
who once recommended a dishonest or incapable
servant without the proper qualification should be
struck off the books, not allowed to testify again in
that court.</p>

<p>With regard to all transient labor, it should be the
duty of the superintendent to see that the references<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
are reliable before posting, so that those who apply in
haste need not be delayed.</p>

<p>If a dressmaker or charwoman inform the superintendent
that she has worked for A, B, and C, let a
printed circular, addressed to such persons, inquiring
if they can recommend her, and to what degree, be
placed in her hands. To this she should bring written
answers before being allowed to post.</p>

<p>If the institution became popular, books would
have to be kept, corresponding to these glass cases&mdash;one
book for cooks, another for housemaids, and
so on; but the cases should never be given up.
There should always be as many as the room will
hold. Ladies should pay a certain sum for each
servant they obtain; and the servant should pay
for every place she gets, at a rate proportioned to
the wages received. In most intelligence offices, the
servants get two places for the same fee, if they
do not stay over a week in the place, and the lady
gets two girls or more on the same condition. This
works like a premium on change of place. The servant
should prove to the Labor Exchange, that
she did not leave her place of her own will, and
the lady should show that incapacity or insubordination
made it impossible to keep her.</p>

<p>It should be a cash business, and a fee should
be paid for each application. Wanting a cook, you
go down to the room, and consult the proper frame.
Finding, perhaps, forty posters, you select one that
reads like this:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<ul class="index">
 <li class="ifrst">Matilda Haynes.</li>
 <li class="isub1">Irish.</li>
 <li class="isub1">Twenty-five years of age.</li>
 <li class="isub1">In the country four years.</li>
 <li class="isub1">Thoroughly understands plain cooking.</li>
 <li class="isub1">Expects two dollars.</li>
 <li class="isub1">Is willing to go out of town.</li>
 <li class="isub1">Lived last at No. 4, Pemberton Square.</li>
 <li class="isub1">Kept the place six months.</li>
 <li class="isub1">May refer to it.</li>
 <li class="isub1">Can be found at 24, High Street.</li>
</ul>

<p>You first go to Pemberton Square. It is quite
possible that this girl may not be what you want;
but if she is, and your eye tells you that you can
trust the judgment of her referee, you have only to
go to High Street, and make your own terms. If
you are already prejudiced in her favor, you will
go prepared to make some concessions, so that the
chance will be better for you both; and this process
may be repeated without loss of time, till you
are supplied.</p>

<p>You will see that this is quite a feasible plan,
and has two advantages. One is, that you have
access to the books, and can choose for yourself;
the other is, that there would be no waiting-room
for servants, where they should talk with, prejudice,
and morally harm each other. You would also be
saved the pain of rejecting servants to their faces,
on the ground of "greenness," or bodily unfitness.
Such an institution would offer this advantage over
the present offices, that it would direct you to temporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
laborers, and give you in a moment the addresses
of some dozens. Such an institution would
be a very great saver of time, and so a great blessing.</p>

<p>If, in the course of these lectures, any words that
I have spoken have touched your hearts, or carried
conviction to your minds, do not put aside, I beseech
you, such impulse as they may have given.
Remember that, however feebly the subject has been
treated, however presumptuous may seem the attempt,
the subject itself is the most important theme
that is presented to this generation. In my first
lecture I showed you, that while women, ever since
the beginning of civilization, have been sharing the
hardest, and doing the most unwholesome work,
they have also done the <em>worst paid</em> in the world.
I showed you that this poor pay, founded on a
false estimate of woman's value as a human being,
and consequently as a laborer, was filling your streets
with criminals, with stricken souls and bodies, for
whose blood society is responsible to God. Having
proved thus, that women need new avenues of labor,
I tried in my second lecture to show you, that, when
she sought these, she had been met too often by the
selfish opposition of man. I showed also that all
such opposition proved, in the end, unavailing; that
all the work she asks will inevitably be given. I
showed you, from the censuses of Great Britain
and America, how much labor is even now open
to her; that it is not half so necessary to open new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
avenues of labor as to make work itself <em>respectable
for women</em>; and I therefore entreated women to learn
to work thoroughly and well, that men might respect
their labor in the aggregate. "Woman's work"
means nothing very honorable or conscientious now.
Alter its significance till it indicates the best work
in the world.</p>

<p>In my present lecture I have indicated some of
the steps that might be taken to benefit the women
in the heart of this city. To encourage you to take
them, I have briefly pointed out Ellen Woodlock's
remarkable success. Have I kindled any interest
in your minds? Can you enter into such labors?
Have you strength or time or enthusiasm to spare?
In the ballads of Northern Europe, a loving sister trod
out, with her bare feet, the nettles whose fibre, woven
into clothing, might one day restore her brothers to
human form.</p>

<p>Your feet are shod, your nettles are gathered: will
you tread them out courageously, and so restore to
your sisters the nature and the privileges of a blessed
humanity?</p>

<p>Opportunity is a rare and sacred thing. God
seldom offers it twice. In the English fields, the
little Drosera, or sundew, lifts its tiny, crimson head.
The delicate buds are clustered in a raceme, to the
summit of which they climb one by one. The top-most
bud waits only through the twelve hours of a
single day to open. If the sun do not shine, it withers
and drops, and gives way to the next aspirant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>So it is with the human heart and its purposes.
One by one, they come to the point of blossoming.
If the sunshine of faith and the serene heaven of
resolution meet the ripe hour, all is well; but if you
faint, repel, delay, they wither at the core, and your
crown is stolen from you,&mdash;your privilege set aside.
Esau has sold his birthright, and the pottage has
lost its savor.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The law of God, positive law and positive morality, sometimes <em>coincide</em>,
sometimes <em>do not coincide</em>, and sometimes <em>conflict</em>."&mdash;<span class="smcap">John Austin</span>:
<cite>Province of Jurisprudence Defined</cite>.</p></blockquote>


<p class="dropcap">"OF Law, no less can be said than that her seat is
the bosom of God; her voice, the harmony of
the spheres. All things in heaven and earth do her
reverence; the greatest as needing her protection, the
meanest as not afraid of her power."</p>

<p>In reading this magnificent and well-known sentence
from Hooker, the imagination is easily kindled
to a divine prescience. We accept the definition.
Fair before us rise the graceful proportions of eternal
order in society, upon which wait present peace and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
future progress; towards which those bow most reverently
who live most purely and see most clearly.
But alas! if the reader be a woman, her heart may
well sink when the enthusiasm of the moment has
passed; and she must ask, with a feeling somewhat
akin to displeasure, "Of <em>what</em> law realized on earth,
administered in courts, dealt out from legislatures or
parliaments, from republics or autocrats, were these
sublime words written?"</p>

<p>Where in the soft shadows of Oriental hareems, in
the gloom of Hindoo caves, Egyptian pyramids, or
Attic porches, sculptured by divinest art, and luminous
with marbles of every hue; where in the porticos
echoing to Roman stoicism, or the baths floating on
Roman license; where in the saloons of French society,
or by the hearths of good old England; where,
alas! in the free States of America, whether North
or South,&mdash;has a system of law prevailed that women
could think of, without blasphemy, as sitting in the
bosom of God, and so entitled to the reverence of
man?</p>

<p>We outgrow all things. Always the new patch
breaks the fabric of the old garment; always the
new wine shatters the well-dried leathern pouch
which held the vintage of our ancestors. But most
of all do we outgrow, have we outgrown, our laws.
They fall back, dead letters, into the abyss of that
past from which we have emerged. We put new
laws upon the statute-book, and do not pause to wipe
out the old; finding our protection in the public feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
and the public progress, if not in the traditions of
the elders.</p>

<p>This, and this only, saves old systems from violent
demolition. Were the State of Connecticut at this
moment to attempt to put in force such of the blue-laws
as are technically unrepealed, she would be met
by the open rebellion of her highest officer; and the
chief-justice who should attempt to fine a bishop for
kissing his wife on Sunday might shake hands cordially
with the chief-justice who once ruled that a
man might beat his wife with a stick no bigger than
his thumb!</p>

<p>The laws which relate to woman are based, for the
most part, on a very old and a very Oriental estimate
of her nature, her powers, and her divinely ordained
position. We shall see this, if we follow the course
of legal enactments or religious prohibitions from the
beginning. When the subject of Woman's Civil
Rights first came to be considered, it was customary
to quote from the scholars one of the sayings of
Vishnu Sarma: "Every book of knowledge which is
known to Oosana or to Vreehaspatee is by nature implanted
in the understandings of women."</p>

<p>Nobody asked what sort of knowledge was known
to these two deities; but most readers took it for
granted that it was divine: and ordinary people asked
why, if society began with this reverent faith, we had
nothing better now than the practical scepticism of
priest and lawyer. When the names of these two
deities were translated into Venus and Mercury (that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
is, into <em>love</em> and <em>cunning</em>), the announcement seemed
more in keeping with the subsequent revelations of
Vishnu Sarma:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Women, at all times," he says, "have been inconstant,
even among the Celestials."</p>

<p>"Woman's <em>virtue</em> is founded upon a modest countenance,
precise behavior, rectitude, and a <em>deficiency of suitors</em>."</p>

<p>"In infancy, the father should guard her; in youth, her
husband; in old age, her children: for at no time is a woman
fit to be trusted with liberty."</p>

<p>"Infidelity, violence, deceit, envy, extreme avarice, a total
want of good qualities, with impurity, are the innate faults
of womankind."</p></blockquote>

<p>These extracts will throw some light, perhaps,
upon the knowledge of Oosana and Vreehaspatee,
and will save modern women from any very strong
desire to restore the "good old rule." After such a
commentary on this seeming compliment, we shall
not think it strange, that, in a country where dialect
is the exponent of condition, the most ancient drama
represents the Hindoo wife as addressing her lord
and master in the dialect of a slave.</p>

<p>"It is proper," says an ancient Hindoo scripture,
"for every woman, after her husband's death, to burn
herself in the fire with his corpse." I quote this saying
here only to advert to the power of public opinion,
which has been strong enough for ages to
compel this sacrifice. But for it, many a woman,
who had been burnt during her whole conjugal life in
the fires of tyranny, self-will, and arrogant dominion,
might have hailed with joy the hour of her release.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Under it, such a woman went calmly to the new
martyrdom.</p>

<p>An ancient Chinese writer tells us, that the newly
married woman should be but an echo in the house.
Her husband may strike her, starve her, nay, even <em>let
her out</em>! Such was the spirit of most Oriental custom
and law. It has crossed the Ural; so that Köhl,
the German traveller, tells us that a Turk blushes
and apologizes when he mentions his wife, as if he
had been guilty of a needless impertinence. The
same thing is reported of one of the Sclavic tribes,
among whom it may have been borrowed from their
Ottoman conquerors.</p>

<p>In the "London Quarterly" for October, 1860, we
are told that the convent of Nuestra Senhora da
Ajuda in Rio was long employed for the purpose of
locking up ladies whose husbands were on their
travels. This has been forbidden by the present
emperor.</p>

<p>There were, however, singular exceptions to the
prevailing estimate. In the Island of C&oelig;lebes,
where the government is republican in form, the
president, and four out of six councillors, are not unfrequently
women. In the diary of the Marquess of
Hastings, we are told, that among the Garrows, a
populous and independent clan in the hill country in
the north-east of India, all property and authority
descend in the female line. On the death of the
mother, the bulk of the possessions goes to the favorite
daughter, <em>so</em> designated, without regard to primogeniture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
in her lifetime. The widower has a stipend
settled on him at the time of marriage, and a moderate
portion is given to each daughter. The sons are
expected to support themselves. A woman, called
Muhar, is the chief of each clan. Her husband is
called Muharree, and has a representative authority,
but no right to her property. Should he incline to
squander it, the clan will interfere in her behalf.
When the Duke of Wellington fought the battle of
Assaye, in 1803, against the Mahrattas, a woman, the
Begum of Lumroom, belonging to the military tribe
of Nairs, fought against him at the head of her cavalry.
In this tribe the succession follows, according
to the duke's report, the female line. This was on
the coast of Malabar, south of Bombay, and in what
we should call the south-western part of the Deccan.
In spite of the difference in orthography, and the
statement about the north-east, I think these stories
may refer to the same clan. An orthography so variously
rendered as the East Indian is a blind guide.</p>

<p>Quite evident is it that the proverbs of more
western and later-born nations grew out of the estimate
of Vishnu Sarma and his compeers. Look at
them:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"A rich man is never ugly in the eyes of a girl."</p>

<p>"A beautiful woman, smiling, tells of a purse gaping."</p>

<p>"Every woman would rather be handsome than good."</p>

<p>"A house full of daughters is a cellar full of sour beer."</p>

<p>"Three daughters and the mother are four devils for the
father."</p>

<p>"A man of straw is worth a woman of gold."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>"A rich wife is a source of quarrel."</p>

<p>"'Tis a poor roost where the hen crows."</p>

<p>"A happy couple is a husband deaf and a wife blind."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is quite evident, I think, that men made these
proverbs; and somewhat mortifying, not to <em>women
only</em>, but to our common humanity, that they should
have the run of society and the newspapers, in an
age which has given birth to Florence Nightingale,
Mary Patton, and Dorothea Dix,&mdash;women who have
been born only to remind us that their counterparts
appeared a thousand years ago.</p>

<p>Aristophanes and Juvenal, Boileau and Churchill,
turn these slanderous proverbs into verse, if not
into poetry; and, in examining the laws of more
modern times, we shall constantly trace the effect of
the old Oriental estimate. In all such examinations,
we have four points to consider:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>1st, That estimate of woman on which her civil
position is founded, and those rights of property
which are granted or refused to her accordingly.</p>

<p>2d, Such laws as relate to marriage and divorce.</p>

<p>3d, Such laws or customs as keep woman out of
office, off the jury, and refuse her all authorized legitimate
interference in public affairs.</p>

<p>4th, Her right of suffrage.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of these points, the discussion of such laws as relate
to marriage and divorce is alone to be restricted
by any considerations of prudence. It has never
seemed to me a wise thing to open needlessly this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
discussion; and the opening of it by women is needless,
while they are in no position to discuss it equally
with men. In the marriage relation, whatever is the
certain loss and misery of one sex is also the certain
loss and misery of the other. Whatever inequality and
injustice appertains to it will be best removed when
the two sexes can consider it together, like two equal
and competent powers.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> I shall advert to the laws
of marriage and divorce, only to point out mistakes
or bad results not generally perceived, and make no
attempt to treat them at length.</p>

<p>When we consider what sort of public opinion has
educated woman, what estimate has lain at the bottom
of all the laws passed concerning her, it does not
seem strange, that, after living for ages in a false position,
she should somewhat approximate to this estimate;
so that we say with pain of the mass of women,
that <em>they themselves</em> need a change quite as much as
their circumstances. It is common, in treating of
this subject, to dwell on the position of woman under
the Roman law; but very little is gained by it. We
can see by the literature of the nation what estimate
was put upon woman, and what share she took in the
degradation of society; but how far this was the consequence
of bad law, what changes were wrought from
the time of Justinian, not merely in law, but in moral
soundness under the law, it is not easy to tell in a
country which had neither printing-presses nor newspapers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
We have only the judgment of a few men,
themselves law-makers, to rely upon; and their opinions
had a very limited circulation in their lifetime, and
could not be tested by any cotemporaneous verdict.
It is in vain that we listen to testimony when no competent
witnesses appear on the "other side." Women,
however, ought always to remember to whom they
owe the changes made in Justinian's time. The life
of Theodora is yet to be written. The scandalous
anecdotes of a secret history must some day be balanced
by the public testimony of Procopius, and some
good be told of the woman whose first thought, when
raised to empire, was for the companions of her previous
infamy, and whose influence over her husband
never faltered, and is visible in every modification of
the laws relating to her sex. If we could realize the
corruptness of the higher classes of society, we should
not wonder at the emperor who chose his wife from
the streets; and the fact itself tells a story which he
who <em>heeds</em> need not misunderstand.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>The laws which most directly affect us here in
America are the laws of France and England: the
laws of France, because they modify the code of
Canada, Florida, and Louisiana; the laws of England,
because in her common law, recognized all over
the country by all the States, we find the basis of all
that is objectionable in our legislation.</p>

<p>First, then, let us consider the estimate on which
the French law is based, and then its property-laws.
Civil position and the right of franchise can be disposed
of in a few words the world over. "There is
one thing which is not French," said Bonaparte, as he
closed a cabinet council, while preparing his famous
Code; "and that is, a woman who can do as she
pleases."</p>

<p>The estimate of woman in France is of a double
character.</p>

<p>It is <em>low</em>, because marriage among the upper classes
is, at the best, only a well-made bargain.</p>

<p>It is <em>high</em>, because women have been encouraged to
enter trade, both by law, which protects them in their
capacity as merchants, and by the military character
of the nation, which prevents men from entering business.</p>

<p>It is <em>low</em>, because throughout the provinces there
are remnants of old feudal custom, which keep her
in the position of a slave. The peasant's wife rarely
sits at table: she crouches in the chimney-corner,
eating from the stew-pan; while her husband sits
at the table in state before his porringer. Yet, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
another respect, this very woman helps to raise the
estimate of her sex; for she works with her husband
in the field, while a wealthier wife is often only a
burden. Like him, she is exposed to all the changes
of the weather. Pregnancy does not save her from
the plough or the vintage. While her husband rests
at noon, she must nurse her babe or prepare his meal.</p>

<p>In most countries, it is desirable to turn the
thoughts of women away from love, and give them
some healthier occupation. In France, it would be
well to stimulate the affections, because covetousness,
a desire of worldly position, or splendid wealth,
is the main motive to a marriage. With us, love
constitutes the whole life of many a woman; while
it may be only an episode in that of her husband.</p>

<p>In France, even woman seldom loves, but marries
to establish herself in life. It is against this greed
that she needs to be cautioned, <em>not</em> against that
emotion and sentiment which God meant should be
both a safeguard and a blessing. <em>Love</em> must rescue
woman from vanity, self-indulgence, and empty show.
Only through its divine power will she come to perceive
the true nature of that shameful bargain, by
which she surrenders what is most precious to appease
the thirst of society. If we would save and
serve humanity <em>here</em>, we must let natural susceptibilities
have their full play.</p>

<p>At the same time, the business freedom which
women enjoy in France has led many women to
reflect thoroughly and act vigorously. The reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
world is deluged with books relating to woman,&mdash;her
education, her labor, and her civil rights. Out
of this condition of things spring a class who long
to share the sorrow and responsibility as well as
the joy of liberty. They will not accept the tenderness
and pity of such men as Michelet, who veil
a profound sensualism with the graces of an affected
sentimentality. Sometimes, like George Sand, these
women break loose from social ties, test the world
for themselves, and, when they have squeezed the
orange which looked so tempting, show to others
the empty, bitter rind, and return gladly to the daily
bread of Divine Ordinance. Once, in Rosa Bonheur,
fresh and wise, energetic and vigorous, the French
woman has challenged the attention of the civilized
world. With no womanish weaknesses, frank, loyal,
and endowed with a serious and reflective nature,
this artist has asked no leave to be of church or
society. "I have no patience," she once said, "with
women who ask permission to think. Let women
establish their claims by great and good works, and
not by conventions." She took the whole world in
her two brave woman's hands, <em>found</em> her inheritance,
and resolved to enjoy it.</p>

<p>It is in France, too, that Clara Demars thinks
out all the psychological relations of love and marriage,
and reminds us of Mrs. John Stuart Mill, by
saying that "truth will never reign over the world,
nor between the sexes, until, by being set free,
woman loses all temptation to dissimulate."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>There, too, Flora Tristan provokes a smile by
echoing in prose the rhythmic platitudes of Mr.
Coventry Patmore, and claiming, not <em>equality</em>, but
sovereignty and autocracy, for woman.</p>

<p>There Pauline Roland boldly claims that marriage
shall never be tolerated, till man as well as woman
is compelled to keep the law of chastity.</p>

<p>There Madame Moniot claims her civil rights from
the lecturer's desk; and Désirée Gay, interesting herself
practically in the question of woman's labor, rules
the women of the national workshops.</p>

<p>When both sides of this picture are studied; when
we look back, on the one hand, to Marie Antoinette
and Madame Récamier, and, on the other, to Madame
Roland, Madame de Staël, and Marie de Lamourous,&mdash;it
is not strange that the fanciful protectorship
of such men as Michelet should be balanced by
a claim, made not only by Talleyrand, but Condorcet,
for woman's full equality as a laborer and a citizen.
And this varying and inconsistent estimate of
woman, made evident in the social, industrial, and
literary spheres of France, is strangely sustained by
her legal enactments. The "Code Napoléon" is
founded on the Roman, and is very similar to the
English common law, so far as it concerns woman:
but beside this law, which is called, in reference to
married women, the <em>dotal</em>, there is another, called the
<em>communal</em>; and, before marriage, parties may choose
between these two. That contract once signed, they
must abide by their choice ever after. If the dotal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
law is founded on Roman law and usage, and so
came naturally enough to prevail in Southern France
until the time of the Revolution; so the communal
law prevailed at the North, and is founded on the
German habits and laws, beneath which always lay
the idea, that, if not technically a laborer, the wife,
by care and industry,&mdash;the thrift of the housewife,&mdash;contributed
to the acquisition of property.</p>

<p>It is very singular that all the nations of Continental
Europe, with the exception of Spain, have
rejected the dotal or Roman law. The objection to
it seems to have arisen out of the fact, that it permits
the wife's property to be settled <em>solely</em> on herself,
and to be so secured against her husband's
debts. In the community of estates, the property
of each is liable for the debts of either. It was on
this account, probably, that, while the "Code Napoléon"
elucidated and defined the dotal system, it
expressly provided for the right of choice in the
parties, and declared, that, if no choice were made,
they should be supposed to be living under the
German or communal law.</p>

<p>The Dutch law is essentially the same. When the
"Code Napoléon" came into force, there were not
wanting French legislators to say, that woman was
now better <em>protected</em> than ever before. But this <em>legal
protection</em> is of a kind due only to minors and lunatics.
This law, like our own, suspects, not only the
<em>intelligence</em> of woman, but her integrity; and aims
not to protect <em>her</em>, but <em>man</em>, against her weakness or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
fraud. In marriage, the husband administers for both,
not only the common property, but her personal possessions.
That is to say, by <em>pretending to protect it</em>,
the law <em>takes away</em> from woman her personal property.
It often happens, that a woman who has
brought her husband a large property is compelled to
shift in narrow ways, like a beggar or a miser, on
account of his parsimony or personal ill-will.</p>

<p>The wife cannot give away the smallest article, not
even such as have been gifts to her: and the 934th
article of the "Code Napoléon" declares, "that the
wife may not accept a gift without the consent of her
husband; or, if he should refuse, without the approbation
of a magistrate." She cannot pledge their
common property, even though it were to set her husband
free when imprisoned for debt; nor, in the event
of his absence, to secure necessaries for his children,
without the same magisterial authority. Commonly,
this authority would be readily obtained; but it is easy
to see that many cases might arise, when, from defeated
purposes, personal enmity, or the influence of the
husband against her, it would be all but impossible.</p>

<p>Even in case of bankruptcy, French legislators tell
us, the rights of the wife are protected. But this
very protection is insulting; for it treats the wife as
if she must of necessity be either an inert instrument
in the hands of her husband, or a dupe, whose weakness
he might readily abuse. <em>Through</em> such protection,
the dishonest merchant finds it easy to defraud
his creditors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, this "Code Napoléon" says that "the husband
owes protection to his wife; and the wife, on
her side, owes obedience to her husband:" but it
goes on to secure the obedience by giving an unlimited
right to the person of the wife, without in any
way providing the promised protection.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The wife must live with her husband, and follow him
wherever he sees fit to go. As for him, he must receive her,
and furnish her with necessaries according to her wealth and
rank."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, this clause actually constrains no one but the
wife; for what would be the condition of a woman
who followed her husband against his will, and remained
<em>under</em> his roof when he was determined that
she should quit it? Under such circumstances, his
recognition of her wealth and rank would be very apt
to fall to the level of his own irritation.</p>

<p>The French code will interfere to protect a wife
against the total loss of her property, if she can
prove <em>some</em> loss already experienced, either from the
improvidence or the bad conduct of her husband;
but it keeps her powerless to protect herself against
that first loss. Having thus, and for such reasons,
obtained a separate jurisdiction over her property,
she cannot alienate, mortgage, or acquire a title to
new property, without her unworthy husband's consent
in person or on paper. The guardianship of the
children is left to the survivor of the marriage; but
the mother's right in such case may be restrained by
the father's and husband's will. He can appoint a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
trustee to be associated with her. As a business
woman, even if separated in estate, the wife cannot
make or dissolve a contract without the consent of
her husband.</p>

<p>As a "public merchant" under the communal system,&mdash;that
is, pledged in <em>her own name</em>,&mdash;she is free
from this restraint. As a citizen of the French republic,
she in that case supports, conjointly with her husband,
all State charges. She is taxed as much as he;
for their common income is diminished as much for
one as for the other. She has no suffrage; but, on the
other hand, she is not liable for military service. She
has no rights; a state of things, which, if it be excusable
when she is absorbed into her husband's personality,
is only absurd when she fulfils all the functions
of a citizen. Well may Legouvé exclaim, "that, if the
household be woman's own sphere, she ought to be
queen in it; and her own faculties should secure her
this supremacy. Her opponents should be forced, on
their own principles, to emancipate her as daughter,
wife, and mother." The woman who owns an estate
is, under this law, sole mistress of it. She signs the
leases and makes the bargains. She pays the State
tax, an additional rate to her own department, a town
tax, and a tax on roads. It is with her that the local
or general government treat, if they cut through her
estate for public ends. Against them, if wronged, she
herself carries suit. By her influence as a proprietor,
she controls many votes; yet she is not permitted to
cast one. She cannot <em>directly</em> control the position of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
the very representative who imposes her taxes. She
is in the same position with regard to all the higher
officers, who decide such questions as affect the value
of her estate. As citizen, therefore, under the communal
law, her position is uncertain and contradictory.</p>

<p>So much for the estimate of woman in France;
and so much for the rights of property, of marriage,
and of suffrage, founded upon that estimate. What
is her <em>civil position</em>? what office or employment is
open to her? Women are better off in France, it is
again said, than ever before. As merchants, fair
chances, barred by some contradictions and anomalies,
await them; but whoever ponders their condition
cannot fail to see, that here, as elsewhere, the protection
afforded by the law is merely the vigilance of a
police officer, which protects the criminal, not for <em>her
own</em> sake, but for that of society, which her very existence
is supposed to endanger.</p>

<p>The most desirable amelioration of her lot will
be secured by the admission of her free personality.
When society strikes out from the statute-book all
distinctions of sex, and admits that she is a person
capable of thinking and acting for herself, she will
lay the foundation of a new civilization.</p>

<p>In France, we are told, women sometimes fill public
functions. They may be postmistresses, and inspectors
of schools; or they may take charge of the
bureaus of wood or tobacco. They may also be
inspectors of public asylums,&mdash;a right and a duty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
of very great importance. As a public functionary,
woman fills few and inferior posts; but in these she
exercises and possesses all the rights of a man, with
one exception,&mdash;that exception, alas! the very keystone
on which all human success must rest: I mean,
the right of <em>promotion</em>. Do not smile, prompted by
an unworthy apprehension of my meaning. It is <em>not</em>
because women are more greedy or more ambitious
than men that I call the right to promotion the
keystone of their success. Only small and narrow
natures can be content in a treadmill. If constant
motion will not carry her over the top of the wheel,
instinct prompts the reasoning creature to abate her
efforts. No man of his own free will turns into a
road which abuts upon a stone wall. The State
turnpike is better, where the wayfarer may die by
a sunstroke, or perish of a frost; where endless miles
stretch over uncultivated wastes: better; for here, at
least, the way is open, the sky overhead.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to speak of the English common
law, it will perhaps be well to turn from the "Code
Napoléon" to the law of Louisiana, in which the influence
of the two forms of French law still shows itself.
I do not consider the laws of Canada, because they
are complicated, not only by the English common
law, but by Canadian statutes, somewhat in the
spirit of our own recent enactments, and by curious
archæological remains of feudal law,&mdash;laws which
would sound like the decrees of Haroun al Raschid,
were I to tax your soberness by setting them before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
you. They are, let us be thankful, of small practical
importance, as is the great body of all law.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>In Louisiana, according to the civil code of 1824,
the partnership of gains arising during coverture
exists by law in every marriage, without express
stipulation to the contrary. But the parties may
regulate their married obligations as they please,
provided they do nothing immoral. The wife's property
is "dotal." What she <em>brings</em>, her paraphernalia,
is "extra-dotal." The dowry belongs to the husband
during marriage; and he has the administration of
the partnership, and may alienate his revenue, without
his wife's consent: but he cannot convey the
common estate. If, before marriage, he should stipulate
that there should be no partnership, his wife
preserves the entire control of her own property.
Her heirs take her separate estate; even money received
by her husband on her account. If there be
no agreement as to the expenses, the wife contributes
one-half of her income. Her landed estate, whether
dotal or not, is not affected by his debts. She is a
privileged creditor, and has the first mortgage on
his property.</p>

<p>If the parties have agreed to the "partnership of
gains," the common property is liable for the debts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
of either. On the death of either party, one-half of
the property goes to the survivor; the other, to the
heirs of the dead partner.</p>

<p>You will perceive that this law seems a loose
mixture of the Roman or dotal system with the
German communal law, based on the partnership
of gains; but the common law takes it for granted
that the partnership exists, where there is no express
stipulation to the contrary. As a public trader, the
wife may bind herself in whatever relates to her
business, without her husband's consent,&mdash;may even
make a will; and reference is made to the "Code
Napoléon," in the same way, to all appearance, that
we refer to the common law of England.</p>

<p>The estimate of woman upon which the "Code
Napoléon" is founded has the same effect upon her
earnings as the English common law. As, in marriage,
the policy has been to keep her subordinate and
inferior; to give her no privileges which should lead
to independence: so, in business, the effect of the
law is to keep the price of her work down, and
give her as few escapes from household drudgery
as may be; to offer her, in fact, no <em>temptation</em> to
escape.</p>

<p>As polishers, burnishers, and copper-workers; as
glove-makers, enamellers, and wire-drawers; as flax-beaters
and soakers; as spinners, gauze-workers, and
winders; as basket-makers, and temperers of steel;
as knife-handlers, embroiderers, and wheel-turners; as
velvet-makers, cockle-gatherers, and ivory-workers; as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
packers, knitters, satin-makers, and folders; as picture-colorers,
and workers in wood; as casters, weighers,
and varnishers; as shoe-makers, strap-makers, lace-makers,
and cocoon-winders,&mdash;the French employ
many women; and the estimate of the law is practically
indicated, there as well as here, in the price
of the labor done.</p>

<p>The highest wages marked upon my list are those
paid to the workers in a porcelain factory, who received
one franc and fifty centimes a day, or thirty
cents. The lowest are those paid to cockle-gatherers
and lace-makers; that is, from twenty to twenty-five
centimes, or from four to five cents a day.</p>

<p>The fact that the poor lace-makers, who lose their
eyesight and their lives bending over their bobbins,
are paid the same wages as the loitering girls who
pick up gay cockles on the beach, shows how little
the price of the labor depends on the value of the
work done, and tells the whole story in a breath.
The wages of the needlewomen of Paris have been
diminishing ever since 1847, and, according to the
"Revue des Deux Mondes," now average only from
twenty to twenty-five cents a day.</p>

<p class="dropcap">IN approaching the subject of English common
law, we come nearer to our own special interests.
Twenty years ago, I am safe, I think, in presuming
that this law was the basis of all our legislation in
regard to woman, if we except that in French or
Spanish territory; and, in criticising its provisions, I
shall criticise all that is objectionable, whether in the
laws that have been changed, or in the laws that
remain to be changed, in our own States.</p>

<p>If we were to examine the literature of England
with reference to this subject, we should probably
find from the beginning many protests against the
present position of woman. It is never safe, for instance,
to assume what poets may or may <em>not</em> have
said. If Dryden could get so far as to say that there
is "no sex in souls," one would think the gentle
Chaucer and heavenly-minded Daniel doubtless discerned
still deeper things; but of lawyers we may
say with some truth, that their early protests were so
quietly made as scarcely to be recognized, or were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
made for the most part by unread and anonymous
writers.</p>

<p>In the "Lawe's Resolution of Woman's Rights,"
published in the year 1632, there seems to be a distinct
recognition of the true nature of the law:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The next thing that I will show you," says the author,
"is <em>this</em> particularity of law. In this consolidation which we
call wedlock is a locking together. It is true, that man and
wife are one person; but understand in what manner. When
a small brooke or little river incorporateth with Rhodanus,
Humber, or the Thames, the poore rivulet looseth her name;
it is carried and recarried with the new associate; it beareth
no sway; it possesseth nothing during coverture. A woman,
as soon as she is married, is called <em>covert</em>; in Latine, <em>nupta</em>,&mdash;that
is, 'veiled;' as it were, clouded and overshadowed:
she hath lost her streame. I may more truly, farre away,
say to a married woman, Her new self is her superior; her
companion, her master."</p>

<p>Still farther: "Eve, because she had helped to seduce her
husband, had inflicted upon her a special bane. See here the
reason of that which I touched before,&mdash;that women have
no voice in Parliament. They make no laws, they consent
to none, they abrogate none. All of them are understood
either married or to be married, and their desires are to
their husbands. I know no remedy, though some women can
shift it well enough. The common lawe here shaketh hand
with divinitye."</p></blockquote>

<p>In this plain statement of the old black-letter book
lies the root of the evil with which we contend: "All
of them are married or to bee married, and their
desires are to their husbands." Woman, single, widowed,
or pursuing an independent vocation, never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
seems to have entered the head of the law, as a possible
monster worth providing for. The world of
that day believed in the <em>sea-serpent</em>, but not in her.
This book, "The Lawe's Resolution of the Rights of
Woman," was, so far as I know, first brought under
our notice by Mrs. Bodichon's quotation, in her
"Brief Summary of the English Law." Then a few
copies found their way to this country, and into the
hands of curious persons. People began to wonder
who wrote the quaint old book. In pleading before
our own Legislature in the spring of 1858, I was
myself asked by the committee who was its author;
and I think it but right to rescue from oblivion the
probable name of this early friend to woman and
justice. It is always difficult to trace an anonymous
book, and, this time, more difficult than usual, as it
was probably published <em>after</em> its author's death.</p>

<p>Sir John Doderidge, to whom my attention was directed
by an eminent antiquarian, was an able lawyer,
and an industrious compiler of law-books of a special
kind. He was from Devonshire, and admitted as a
barrister in 1603. He was successively appointed
Solicitor-General, Judge of the Common Pleas and
of the King's Bench. Among the works known to
be his, yet not commonly included in the list of his
works, are the "Lawyer's Light," published in 1629;
and "The Complete Parson," with the laws relating
to advowsons and livings, in 1670,&mdash;books of the
same class, character, and appearance as the "Lawe's
Resolution."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>As he died in 1628, I was at first inclined to suspect
the fairness of this inference: but a further examination
showed that all his publications were <em>posthumous</em>;
which accounts, perhaps, for the <em>candor</em> of their
covert satire. A few particulars of his life and standing
may be gained from the new Life of Lord Bacon,
where Hepworth Dixon says that "the Solicitor-Generalship,
vacant once more, is given, over Francis
Bacon's head, to Sir John Doderidge, Serjeant of the
Coif." In 1606, when Sir Francis Gawdy dies,
"Coke goes up to the bench; and Doderidge, the
Solicitor-General, ought, by the custom of the law,
to follow Coke, leaving the post of Solicitor void:
but Cecil raises Sir Henry Hobart, his obscure Attorney
of the Court of Wards, over both Doderidge
and Bacon's head, to the high place of Attorney-General."
Since that day, Bentham and Catharine
Macauley, Mary Wollstonecraft, and John Stuart
Mill, have made the same complaint; sustaining it,
however, by vigorous argument for woman's full
emancipation, and a demand for the right of suffrage.</p>

<p>Let us look at this English law. So far as it
affects <em>single</em> women, it is very simple.</p>

<p>A single woman has the same rights of property as
a man; that is, she may get and keep, or dispose of,
whatever she can. She has a right, like man, to the
protection of the law, and has to pay the same taxes
to the State.</p>

<p>"Duly qualified," she may <em>vote</em> on parish questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
and for parish officers; and "duly qualified," in England,
means that she shall have a certain amount of
property, and so a vested interest in the prosperity
of her parish. If her parents die without a will, she
shares equally with her brothers in the division of the
personal property; but her eldest brother and his
issue, even if female, will take the real estate as heirs-at-law.
If she be an only child, she inherits both
personal and real, and becomes immediately that most
pitiable of creatures, an heiress.</p>

<p>The church and all state offices are closed to women.
They find some employment in rural post-offices; but
there is no important office they can hold, if we except
that of sovereign. This is sometimes spoken of
as an inconsistency; but if we reflect upon the position
of a constitutional sovereign, whose speeches are
the work of her minister, and whose actions indicate
the average conscience of a cabinet council, we shall
find her legally but very little more independent than
other women technically classed with minors and
idiots.</p>

<p>There have been a few women governors of prisons,
overseers of the poor, and parish clerks; but
public opinion still effectually bars most women from
seeking or accepting office.</p>

<p>The office of Grand Chamberlain was filled by two
women in 1822. That of Clerk of the Crown, in
the Court of Queen's Bench, has been granted to a
female; and, in a certain parish of Norfolk, a woman
was recently appointed parish clerk, because, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
population of six hundred souls, no man could be
found able to read and write!</p>

<p>In an action at law, it has been determined that an
unmarried woman, having a freehold, might vote for
members of Parliament. Mr. Higginson tells us that
a certain Lady Packington returned two.</p>

<p>In all periods, there have been women who have
held exceptional positions, under peculiar influence of
wealth or rank or circumstances; and though this
has not affected the position of other women, or given
them any more freedom, yet it is valuable in itself,
because it has kept the <em>possibility</em> of their employment
always open, and acted like a practical protest against
the law.</p>

<p>The Countess of Pembroke was hereditary Sheriff
of Westmoreland, and exercised her office. In the
reign of Queen Anne, Lady Rous did the same, "girt
with a sword." Henry VIII. once granted a commission
of inquiry, under the great seal, to Lady Anne
Berkeley, who opened it at Gloucester, and passed
sentence under it.</p>

<p>Some of the old legal writers averred, that a woman
might serve in almost any of the great offices of the
kingdom. Lately we find it stated that a woman may
be elected as constable, since she can <em>hire a man</em> to
serve for her; but she may <em>not</em> be elected overseer
of the poor, because, in this case, substitution, if not
impossible, would be difficult!</p>

<p>What were the peculiar political excitements which
enabled Lady Packington to return two members of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Parliament, we are not told; but it is quite certain
that women of twenty-one, duly qualified, cannot and
do not vote for members of Parliament by virtue of
that decision. In rural districts, where personal influence
weighed a good deal, such a vote might be
courteously winked at. A woman of property and
standing, in Nova Scotia, has in this manner, for
more than forty years, cast her annual vote, without
rebuke or interruption; but, should any <em>number</em> of
women act on this precedent, a legal restraint would
doubtless be laid.</p>

<p>No single woman, having been seduced, has any
remedy at common law; neither has her mother nor
next friend. If her father can prove <em>service</em> rendered,
he may sue for loss of service.</p>

<p>In what "bosom of divinitye" does this law rest?
Here is a remedy for the loss of a few hours, but no
penalty held up <em>in terrorem</em>, to warn man that he may
not trifle with honor, womanly purity, and childish
ignorance or innocence.</p>

<p>In the eye of this law, female chastity is only valuable
for the work it can do. It must not be thought,
however, that the English common law stands alone
in this moral deformity. Under the French law, female
chastity does not seem of any worth, even in
consideration of the work it can do. In honest indignation,
Legouvé exclaims,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Let a man, who has seduced a child of fifteen years by a
promise of marriage, be brought before a magistrate. He has
under the law a right to say, 'There is my signature, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
true; but I deny it. A debt of the heart is void before the
law.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus everywhere, in practice and theory, in society
and in law, for rich and poor, is public purity abandoned,&mdash;the
bridle thrown upon the neck of all restive
and depraved natures.</p>

<p>Manufacturers seduce their work-people; the heads
of workshops refuse to employ girls who will not sell
themselves, soul and body, to them; masters corrupt
their servants. Out of 5,083 lost women counted by
Duchâtelet at Paris in 1830, there were 285 domestic
servants seduced, and afterwards dismissed by their
employers. Commission-merchants, officers, students,
deceive the poor girls from the province or the country,
drag them to Paris, and leave them to perish.
At all the great centres of industry, as at Rheims and
at Lille, are societies organized to recruit the houses
of sin in Paris.</p>

<p>This is well known to be true of all the large English
towns; yet the law is powerless, and philanthropy
interferes with no other result than that of driving
these societies from one post to another.</p>

<p>Can women be expected to believe that the law
would be powerless, if there were a sound public
opinion behind it to sustain the law; if there were
any <em>desire</em> on the part of the majority of men that it
should be sustained? "Punish the young girl, if you
will," continued Legouvé; "but punish also the man
who has ruined her. She is already punished,&mdash;punished
by desertion, punished by dishonor, punished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
by remorse, punished by nine months of suffering,
punished by the charge of a child to be reared. Let
him, then, be struck in his turn. If not, it is no longer
public modesty that you defend: it is the 'lord paramount,'
the vilest of the rights of the 'seigneur.'"</p>

<p>In the laws which regard single women, we object,
then,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>1. To the withholding of the elective franchise.</p>

<p>2. To the law's preference of males, and the issue
of males, in the division of estates.</p>

<p>3. We object to the estimate of woman which the
law sustains, which shuts her out from all public employment,
for many branches of which she is better
fitted than man.</p>

<p>4. We object to that estimate of woman's chastity
which makes its existence or non-existence of importance
only as it affects the comfort or income of man.</p></blockquote>

<p>We do not mean that the present <em>interpretation</em> of
the common law does not <em>sometimes</em> show a more
liberal estimate than the law itself, but rather that the
existence of this law, unrepealed, <em>unchristianized</em>, is a
forcible restraint upon the progress of society.</p>

<p>"A legal fiction," says Maine in his "Ancient Law,"
"signifies any assumption which conceals, or affects to
conceal, the fact, that a rule of law has undergone
alteration, its <em>letter</em> remaining unchanged, while its
operation is modified." Such fictions may be useful
in the infancy of society; but, like absurd formulas
and embarrassing technicalities, they should give way
before advancing common sense, before the diffusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
of general intelligence and a common-school system,
which is destined to qualify the humblest man for a
full understanding of the law under which he lives.</p>

<p>We have now to consider the laws concerning <em>married
women</em>. "On whatsoever branch of jurisprudence
may lie the charge," says a late reviewer, "of
working the heaviest sum of suffering, perhaps we
shall not err in saying that the sharpest and cruellest
pangs are those which have been inflicted by our
marriage-laws." In making our abstracts, we have
need to avoid the absurd complications which confuse,
not only simple-minded people, but lawyers themselves;
and, to avoid any charge of ignorance or
mistake, we will, as far as possible, adopt the language
of Mrs. Bodichon's "Summary," which has
stood for six years before the English public without
impeachment.</p>

<p>We shall not discuss the question, as to what constitutes
fitness for marriage in the eye of the law. In
Scotland and in England, the consent of the parties is
said to be the "essence of marriage;" but, alas! in
how many cases is this "consent" taken for granted
only, it being, in fact, the most baseless of legal fictions!</p>

<p>In commenting on the English law as compared
with the Scotch, the reviewer adds, "A code so unsatisfactory,
so unsettled, and by every alteration coming
so palpably near to their own system, is one which
Scotchmen may be pardoned for declining further to
consider, and which certainly they cannot be expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
to recognize as the model to which their own should
be conformed."</p>

<p>The rule of the English law was, at the institution
of the Divorce Court, that the wife should have
the same domicile as her husband, and that within
English territory. A dishonest domicile barred her
claim to divorce; and the husband who abandoned
his wife, and fixed his residence abroad, effectually
bound her to him. Justice has of late been done,
because it was justice, heedless of the question of
domicile.</p>

<p>There are in relation to this subject many provisions
which wrong men and women alike; and, if there
are any which especially wrong woman, they wrong
man in a still higher degree through her. As an
example of the former class, we may take the impossibility
of release from a hopelessly insane partner,
which makes the point of the wonderful story of
"Jane Eyre."</p>

<p>Now, several things are quite evident to the eye
of common sense:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><em>First</em>, That the insane partner should be properly
provided for during life, in the upper classes, by the
sane partner; in the lower, by the parish or state.</p>

<p><em>Second</em>, That as it is a sin against God and society
to bring children into the world, born of a hopelessly
insane parent; so, on the other hand, it is a sin
against God and society to compel any man or
woman to a life of hopeless celibacy.</p>

<p><em>Third</em>, That, if the law does use this compulsion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
it is responsible for the vicious connections that inevitably
grow out of it; "<i xml:lang="Fr">car les mauvaises lois produisent
les mauvaises m&oelig;urs</i>."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> I should not turn
aside from my main point to consider this, even for
a moment, if it were not a striking instance of the
want of common <em>sense</em> which afflicts the common
<em>law</em>, and if I had not in my own experience been
made aware of its frightful results. Within the limits
of one small parish in the city of Toronto, Canada
West, I found four instances in which men of the
middle class had taken the right of divorce into
their own hands, and were illegally married a second
time. These persons, if not markedly religious, were
respectable, orderly members of society, living properly
in their families, supporting the wives they had
left, and justifying the course they had taken. Two
of them had left England on account of the hopeless
insanity of their wives, and two on account
of their hopeless immorality; the latter, cases in
which the law would have granted a divorce, but
at an expense which the husband could not pay.
When I first heard this account of one person, I
resented it as a slander, and went to console the
afflicted wife, who was overwhelmed by the supposed
rumor.</p></blockquote>

<p>The husband met me at the door, with an honest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
unabashed, but distressed face. "Don't deny it to
her," said he. "I never committed but one sin, and
that was when I kept it from her. She was a sweet,
pious creature; and I feared she would not consent."</p>

<p>This man told me that he sent six hundred dollars
yearly to his insane wife; that this kept her better than
he could afford to keep himself and his family: "but,"
said he, "her station was always higher than mine."</p>

<p>In the other cases, the men had told their stories,
and the wives had consented to the arrangement.
It is obvious, that, if a wife wished to withdraw from
a husband in this manner, she could not do it, on
account of property restrictions, and the common
unfitness for self-support.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>In the marriage of a minor, the consent of the
father, or of a guardian appointed by him, is necessary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
but <em>not</em> that of the <em>mother</em>: another indication
of the estimate the law puts upon woman, as compared
with man; and this estimate, whenever and
wherever it shows itself, has the effect to depress
every woman's desire to fit herself to be a good
citizen; and, when she fails in citizenship, man must
fail also, as is ably shown by De Tocqueville.</p>

<p>"A hundred times in the course of my life," he
says, "I have seen weak men display public virtue
because they had beside them wives who sustained
them in this course, not by counselling this or that
action in particular, but by exercising a fortifying influence
on their views of duty and ambition. <em>Oftener
still</em>, I have seen domestic influence operating to
transform a man, naturally generous, noble, and unselfish,
into a cowardly, vulgar, and ambitious self-seeker,
who thought of his country's affairs only to
see how they could be turned to his own private
comfort or advancement; and this simply by daily
contact with an honest woman, a faithful wife, a
devoted mother, from whose mind the grand notion
of public <em>duty</em> was entirely absent."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>A man and wife are one person in law: <em>a wife
loses all her rights</em> as a single woman. Her husband
is legally responsible for her acts: so she is said to
live under his cover. A woman's body belongs to her
husband. She is in his custody, and he can enforce
his right by a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p><em>This last</em> is one of the points in which the public
feeling is so far before the law, that the latter could
never be wholly enforced.</p>

<p>If a woman were unlawfully restrained of her
liberty, her husband might take advantage of a <i xml:lang="Latn">habeas
corpus</i> to get possession of her; but it is not probable
that any court, in England or this country, would
<em>now</em> grant one to compel a wife to live with her
husband against her will. Still, the estimate of the
marriage relation which such laws sustain is so
low, that one never can tell what will happen.</p>

<p>In the year 1858, a curious but <em>unintentional</em> satire
on the judicial position of the husband occurred in
one of the London courts. A delicate, much-abused
woman, unmarried, but who had been, in her own
phrase, "living for some time" with a man, brought
an action against him for assault. Erysipelas had
inflamed her wounds, and endangered her life.</p>

<p>"Had she died, sirrah," said the magistrate, addressing
the criminal, "you must have taken your
trial for murder. What have you to say in your
defence?"</p>

<p>"I was in liquor, sir," pleaded the man. "I gave
her some money to go to market. I told her to look
sharp; but she was gone more than an hour, your
worship: so, when she came back, I&mdash;I was in
liquor, your honor."</p>

<p>The magistrate leaned over his desk, and, speaking
in the most impressive manner, thus endeavored to
cut short the defence:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>"This woman is not your slave, man. She is
not accountable to you for every moment of her
time. She is not," he continued with increasing
fervor, but a growing embarrassment,&mdash;"she is not&mdash;she
is not"&mdash;</p>

<p>He paused; but the throng of wretched women
who crowded the court interpreted the pause aright,
and were not likely to forget the lesson.</p>

<p>A suppressed titter ran through the court: for every
married man knew that the words, "she is not your
wife," were those which had sprung naturally to
the worthy magistrate's lips; and must have passed
them, had not honest shame prevented.</p>

<p>The man then attempted to defend himself on
the ground of jealousy: but this was instantly set
aside; the unmistakable impression left on the mind
of the court-room being, that the illegality of the
relation was wholly in the woman's favor.</p>

<p>Since the war, freed-women at Beaufort, S.C., have
refused marriage for this very reason.</p>

<p>Women long ago understood this, and literary
gossip gives us a late instance in a maiden aunt
of Sir Charles Morgan. This woman, descended
from Morgan the buccaneer, has more than once
turned the scales of an Irish election. When she
once arrested a robber on her own premises, and
held him fast till the arrival of an officer, the gentlemen
of the neighborhood advised her not to prosecute.</p>

<p>"It is well known," they argued, "that you refuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
to employ a single man on your premises, and you
may be marked out for the revenge of the gang."</p>

<p>"Justice is justice," she exclaimed in reply; "and
the villain shall go hang!"</p>

<p>It was quite natural that we should find this
woman telling Lady Caroline Lamb that no <em>man</em>
should ever have legal rights over her, or her property.
A wife's money, jewels, and clothes become
absolutely her husband's; and he may dispose of
them as he pleases, whether he and his wife live
together or not. Her chattels real&mdash;that is, estates
held for a term of years&mdash;and presentations of
church livings become absolutely his; but, if she
survive him, she may resume them.</p>

<p>Under such a common law as this, it is not surprising
to find something needed which is called
<em>equity</em>. Therefore, if a wife, on her marriage, gives
all her property to her husband, the said <em>equity</em>
(Heaven save the mark!) will, under certain circumstances,
oblige him to make a settlement upon her.
That is, when the wife has an interest in property
which can only be reached by the husband through
a court of equity, that court will aid him to enjoy
it, <em>only</em> on condition that such part as it thinks proper
shall be settled on the wife.</p>

<p>The civil courts in England cannot compel a man
to support his wife: <em>that</em> is left to the action of the
church, and her own parish.</p>

<p>A husband has a freehold estate in his wife's
lands as long as they both live.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>Money earned by a married woman belongs absolutely
to her husband.</p>

<p>By her husband's particular permission, she may
make a will; but he may revoke his permission at
any time before probate,&mdash;that is, before the will
is exhibited and proved,&mdash;even if <em>after</em> the wife's
death.</p>

<p>The custody of a child belongs to the father. The
mother has no right of control. The father may
dispose of it as he sees fit. If there be a legal
separation, and no special order of the court, the
custody of the children (except the nutriment of
infants) belongs legally to the father.</p>

<p><em>Except the nutriment of infants!</em> Here is a hint
from the good God himself. Should we not think,
that the first time these words were written down,
and men were compelled to see the natural dependence
of the child upon the mother,&mdash;to detect the
obvious laws of nurture, natural and spiritual,&mdash;the
right of a good mother to her child would have
made itself clear?</p>

<p>Yet, to this day, there are many States of our
own Union where a mother can better authenticate
her right to a negro slave than to the young daughter
who is bone of her bone, and flesh of her flesh!</p>

<p>If the direct influence of Christianity did not, in
some measure, modify the influence of the law in
social life, there would be no such thing as a mother's
exercising maternal authority over a son. No matter
how wise, how old, how experienced, she may be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
she never possesses, in the eye of the law, the dignity
of a boy who has just attained his majority.
Sufficiently instructed in legal maxims, he can always
resist her, under the influence of the most besotted
or unprincipled of fathers.</p>

<p>The word of a married woman is not binding in
law, and persons who give her credit have no remedy
against her.</p>

<p>The moral results of such a law are sufficiently
obvious, not only in England, but in our own country.
The statute-book does not, cannot, stand absolved,
because public opinion in the present day
abhors and contemns the woman who assists her husband
to defraud his creditors, or takes refuge from
her own debts behind this disgraceful cover. Yet, if
the law gives her husband her property, it ought
surely to hold <em>him</em> responsible for her debts. And
this is what society calls <em>protection</em>!</p>

<p>As a wife is always presumed to be under the
control of her husband (numerous instances to the
contrary notwithstanding), she is not considered
guilty of any crime which she commits in his presence.</p>

<p>When a woman has consented to a proposal of
marriage, she cannot give away the smallest thing.
If she do so without her betrothed husband's consent,
the gift is illegal; and, after marriage, he may avoid
it as a fraud on him: a strong temptation to any
woman, one would think, to give away her all. You
see here what estimate the law puts on property, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
an inducement to marriage. This provision evidently
grew out of the exigencies of the time, when marriage
among the Anglo-Saxons was a <em>pure</em> matter of
bargain.</p>

<p>As a protection against the common law, it is
usual to have some settlement of property made
upon the wife; and, in respect to <em>this</em> property, the
courts of equity regard her as a single woman. Such
settlements are very intricate, and should be made by
an experienced lawyer.</p>

<p>The wife's property belonging to the husband,
should her scissors, thimble, or petticoats be stolen,
the indictment must describe either of these articles
as his!</p>

<p>Of divorce it is only necessary to say, that a divorce
from the bonds of matrimony in England could
be obtained only by act of Parliament; the right of
investigation resting with the House of Lords alone.
Until the passage of the New Divorce Bill, only three
such divorces had ever been granted to a woman's
petition. The expense of the most ordinary bill was
between three and four thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Nor need we dwell long on such laws as relate to
<em>widows</em>. You may be interested to hear, that, <em>after</em>
her husband's death, the widow recovers her right to
her own clothes and jewels; also that the law does
not compel her to bury him, that being the duty of
his legal representative.</p>

<p>The indignation which we might naturally feel at
the suggestion that a wife <em>could</em> forsake her unburied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
dead, cools a little as the law goes on to state, that a
husband <em>can</em>, of <em>course</em>, deprive a wife of all share in
his personal estate. Very graciously, also, the widow
is permitted to remain forty days in her husband's
house, provided that she do not <em>re</em>-marry within <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'tha'">that</ins>
time!</p>

<p>The result of a great deal of reading of a great
many law-books is only this,&mdash;that we are more
firmly convinced than ever, that the most necessary
reform is a simple erasure from the statute-book of
whatever recognizes distinctions of sex. You should
make woman, in the eye of the law, what she has
always been in the eye of God,&mdash;a responsible human
being; and make laws which such beings, male
or female, can obey.</p>

<p>Even Christian, in his edition of Blackstone, said
long ago, that there was no reason why civil rights
should be refused to single women. In every respect
but this, the single woman is independent; but let
her take to herself a husband, and the law steps in to
protect her, and she finds herself in a position of
what is called "reasonable restraint." He may give
her, says Blackstone, <em>moderate correction</em>; he may
adopt any act of coercion that does not endanger
life; he may beat her, but not violently. She may,
by her labor, support him: but she cannot prevent
him from bestowing her earnings, should he happen
to die, upon those who have most wronged her in
life; his mistress, it may be, or his illegitimate children.
Do you tell me that men of good feeling never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
act on such laws? Why, then, should men of good
feeling be unwilling to wipe them from the statute-book?</p>

<p>For the most part, it is upon women of the lower
class that the property-laws most hardly press. It
was the suffering of this class, years ago, when the
common law of Massachusetts was the same as that
of England, that first roused my interest, and excited
my indignation; but the story which the Hon. Mrs.
Norton tells us shows that this class of women are
not the <em>only</em> sufferers.</p>

<blockquote><p>"I have learned the law piecemeal," she says, "by suffering
all it could inflict. I forgave my husband's wickedness
again and again, and found too late, that, in the eye of the
law, practical Christianity, the forgiving unto seventy times
seven, was a condonation which deprived me of all protection.
My children were stolen from me, and put into the
vilest custody, where one of them afterwards died for want
of a mother's commonest care. My husband brought an action
against his kindest friend, of whom he borrowed money
and received office. The jury listened with disgust, and
gave their verdict against him. Then I was told that I
might <em>write</em> for my bread, <em>or</em> my family might support me.
My children were kept away, as their residence with me
would make him liable for my debts.</p>

<p>"When my mother died, and left me, through my brother,
a small income, he balanced the first payment by arbitrarily
stopping his own allowance. For the last three years, I
have not received a farthing from him. He retains all my
personal property which was left in his home, the gifts of the
royal family on my marriage, articles bought with my own
earnings, and presents from Lord Melbourne. He receives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
from my trustees the income which my father bequeathed to
me, which the 'non-existent' wife must resign to the 'existent'
husband.</p>

<p>"I have also the power of earning by literature; but even
this power, the gift of God, not the legacy of man, bears
fruit only for him. Let him <em>subp&oelig;na</em> my publishers, and
enjoy his triumph: he has shown me that I was not meant
to write novels and tales, but to rouse the nation against such
men as he, and such laws as they sustain. Let him eat the
bread I earn; but it shall be bought with the price of his
own exposure. If law will not listen to me, to literature
I will devote my power, and secure for others what I have
not been able to secure for myself."</p></blockquote>

<p>No wonder that provident parents circumvent such
a common law by a settlement before marriage!
There is no chance for a partnership of gains or losses
in England.</p>

<p>As we have already said, all sexual laws ought to
be wiped off the statute-book; but the Hungarian law
which was in force until 1849, when the German law
was introduced into Hungary, is a comment on the
absurdity of the English.</p>

<p>"No countrywoman of mine," said a proud sister
of Kossuth, "would ever submit to such a marriage
settlement as is common in England." In Hungary,
inherited property could not be devised by will, and
all unmarried women were considered minors. As
soon as she married, a woman came of age, and into
the full control of her estates. She could make a
will, and sign deeds; and was not responsible for her
husband's debts or the family expenses. As a widow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
she was guardian of her children, and administrator
on her husband's property. So long as she bore his
name, she could exercise all his political rights. She
could vote in the county elections, and for deputies
to the Diet. Trained up under such a law,
what could the Hungarian woman think who found
herself for the first time in the power of the English
law?</p>

<p>Among the refugees whom the misfortunes of a
leading Hungarian family drove to these shores was
one woman of the highest natural gifts, the best social
station. She was married to a man, handsome,
accomplished, and reckless, but hardly patriotic enough
to have need to fly with her. In the city of New York
she opened a boarding-house of the highest class, by
which she strove to support herself and her children.
A fascinating hostess, a skilful manager, she succeeded,
as might be expected. Soon her improvident
husband followed her. At first, he did not attempt to
annoy her; but, in time, some one was found cruel
enough to expound to him the English common law.
He stared, refused to believe; but finally entered his
wife's house, seized her earnings, compelled her boarders
to pay their money into his hands, stripped her of
all power to pay her rent and provide for her family,
and then took himself off, enraptured, doubtless, with
his brief experience of English and American liberty.
Stripped of peace, position, and property, the injured
wife had no longer courage to struggle. In underhand
ways, to evade the unjust law, her personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
friends settled her upon a little farm, where her shattered
hopes found a short repose.</p>

<p>A few years ago, an American woman of captivating
address gained great reputation in Paris as a
milliner. She had a profligate husband, whom she
invited to tea every Sunday, supplying him at that
time with a sum for his weekly expenses. In an evil
day, seduced by promises of high patronage, she went
to London. She was very successful; but in a few
months her husband surprised her, seized all she possessed,
and, turned adrift on the streets, she went back
to a country where the law would protect her industry.
Marriage has been sought only to legalize a theft,&mdash;to
apply the words of Wendell Phillips, when "<em>union
was robbery</em>." A respectable servant, who had laid by
a considerable sum, was sought in marriage by an
apparently suitable person. On the day before the
marriage, she put her bank-book into his hands. After
the ceremony, he said to her, "I am not well in health,
and do not feel equal to supporting a family: you
had better go back to service." Naturally indignant,
she responded, "Give me, then, my bank-book."&mdash;"I
am too feeble to spare the money," he replied.
She went back to service, and has never seen him
since; but, of course, she has been often obliged to
change her name and residence to protect herself from
a long succession of extortions.</p>

<p>We see thus, that if a woman is able to conquer
her fate, and to gain a livelihood in spite of a dissolute
or incompetent husband, her home is not her own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Her husband's folly may, at any moment, deprive her
children of bread.</p>

<p>I have said that there was no woman so pitiable as
an heiress. I said it advisedly. I thought of the long
persecution she must bear from unwelcome suitors,&mdash;of
all appreciation of her personality, ever so lovely
or gifted or individual, sunk, as it must be, in the mire
of her money.</p>

<p>Mrs. Reid says, justly, that this money is not so
much her own as a perquisite attached to her person
for the benefit of her <em>future husband</em>; the larger portion
of which will eventually pass to his heirs, whether
of her blood or not. If forced from ill treatment to
leave his roof, the law will return her but a scanty
pittance.</p>

<p>The nature of the law itself, and that estimate of
woman on which it is based, are so identical, that we
are compelled, as we turn over its pages, to treat
these two points as one.</p>

<p>"For one-half the human race," said Mrs. Reid
years ago, "the highest end of civilization is to <em>cling</em>
like a weed upon a wall;" a curious instance of the
power that the use of language has over a fact.
There is nothing captivating in clinging like a "weed
to a wall;" but most women are satisfied to hang
like the "vine about the oak."</p>

<p>It is a great misfortune, that this estimate of woman
not only governs the courts in their decisions, but enters
into and moulds all the movements of society.
Such an estimate leads to constant contradictions;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
being, as it is, directly the opposite of the <em>fact</em> in so
many cases, and of the Divine Will in all. In a book
on woman recently published by a lawyer in England,
I found a pithy paragraph to this point, concluding
some observations on the comparative longevity of the
sexes: "The wife," he says, "<em>fitly survives the husband</em>,
both to take care of <em>his</em> premature infirmity, and
to consummate the rearing of their offspring"!&mdash;a
creative effort of the imagination which certainly entitles
the writer to the laurels of the century.</p>

<p>One reason that the wages of women are kept
down is, that, for the most part, women do not begin
to labor early; do not devote themselves <em>in youth</em> to
any trade or profession, so as to compete with men
who have. The plodding and steady habits of the
man of business, he has acquired in his early years;
and they are developed by the fact, that he is sole
master of what he can earn, and can dispose of it as
he thinks proper: but his wife has been brought up
in no such school,&mdash;has no such motive to industry.
Should she toil on for ever, she cannot possess what
she acquires, nor lay out the smallest part of it, without
another's leave. Even when man says to her with
the sanction of the church and in the presence of
God, "With all my worldly goods I thee endow," it
means only that she is invited to enjoy, not possess
them. This estimate of her rights, her position,
and her ability, made manifest in every law-book, in
the church itself, and obvious in every social form, discourages
her whenever she would devote herself to any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
lucrative employment; so that it is only in desertion
and despair, for the most part, that she becomes a
laborer. She is not always conscious of this discouragement.
She quiets the Cerberus within by a three-times-repeated
"It is not proper," without pausing to
analyze the conventional instinct. Here we find the
real significance of the proverb, "A man of straw is
worth a woman of gold;" for the "man of straw" is,
at least, worth such money as he may hereafter earn,
which the "woman of gold" is not.</p>

<p>We hear a great deal about laws for the <em>protection</em>
of women; but we cannot urge too often the remark
of James Davis in his Prize Essay of 1854, "that all
early legislation for woman was founded, not on her
own rights, but on those of her husband and children,
and the <em>State over her</em>."</p>

<p>When one remembers that the "seat of the law is
the bosom of God," it strikes one strangely, that moral
consequences to character have so little to do with
what one may call "sexual legislation."</p>

<p>In speaking of the frequenting of disreputable
houses, neither Montesquieu, nor Dr. Wood in his
"History of Civil Law," finds a single word to say
as to the moral degradation of the race, of the special
degradation of woman involved in it, but both
grow eloquent concerning the ruin of the State. It
requires a sounder mode of thinking than most men
possess to see the relation between the ruin of the
State and their own bad habits, the loss of one man's
purity. Thus the laws concerning adultery, or divorce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
for that cause, bring the heaviest penalties, social and
legal, upon the head of an offending woman. The
legal excuse for this positive injustice is the safety of
the family and the State,&mdash;the great crime of imposing
upon a family false representatives of its name
and honor; but a woman's brain and conscience are
too clear to rest in this masculine decision.</p>

<p>If a man cannot bring a false representative into
<em>his own family</em>, he can carry it into his neighbor's,
when his profligate life violates the social compact;
and, as to his own family, his vices may injure it
far more than the infidelity of his wife. At the
worst, her misconduct will only bring into the shelter
of his home a child who grows up protected socially
by her fraud; but, if <em>he</em> choose to "spend his substance
in riotous living," his wife and children may,
while the law gives him exclusive right to their
common property, be deserted, or driven from their
homes, to make room for those who are the companions
of his guilt. It is quite possible, it will be
seen, therefore, to show another side to this matter,
in no better light than that of expediency. One
canton of Switzerland (the Canton Glarus) possesses
laws in regard to such matters, in marked contrast
to those of the whole civilized world. The consequence
is, that the falsehood and crime so common
elsewhere are here unknown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>"Perhaps it would be just," says Poynter on
"Marriage and Divorce," in 1824,&mdash;"<em>perhaps</em> it
would be just, that where the husband violates the
matrimonial compact, and the property originally
belonged to the wife, he should give back the whole
of it. Courts, however, have never gone that length."</p>

<p>One would think, nevertheless, that husbands themselves
might go that length, and that men who aspire
to the credit of decency would be ashamed to eat
the bread of her they have betrayed and wounded.
How is it that they have deceived themselves from
the beginning, and have fancied that God requires
of woman a fidelity and purity that was not of the
smallest consequence to themselves?</p>

<p>In the late debate in Parliament on the New
Divorce Bill, when a member objected to the introduction
of a clause equalizing the relief of divorce
to both sexes, he asked, "If this clause were adopted,
I should like to know how many married men there
would be in this house?" He was answered by
shouts of laughter.</p>

<p>Would these men have laughed, think you, if they
had been asked how many <em>pure wives</em> could be
found in their family circles? and, if <em>not</em>, would it
have been because they were capable of estimating
the value of womanly virtue? No: <em>he</em> cannot estimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
that who has never known the worth of manly
purity. The spectres of illegitimacy and civil ruin
are what would stare them in the face, and turn
their very lips so white.</p>

<p>In France, says the "Westminster Review," fidelity
on the part of the husband is considered a sort
of imbecility. What is thought of it in England?
Does this scene in Parliament, printed for all our
girls to read, suggest any higher view?</p>

<p>"The frequenting of disreputable places," says
Davis, "was once an indictable offence in a <em>man</em>;
but that is now obsolete." Obsolete? and why? A
lawyer once told me, that the most obscene publication
he had ever read was a book upon divorce.
I can well believe it. I thought I knew how corrupt
modern society could be; but I did not know how
unsoundness had darted to its very core, till I began
to read law, and to understand the estimate which
that puts upon woman and chastity.</p>

<p>When I think of these things, I wonder that this
platform is not thronged with the ghosts of dead
and ruined women, crowding here to second my
appeal to beseech you to grant human justice, to
require human virtue! And all this sin is sheltered
under the plea of protection! "How many delicious
morsels I should miss if it were not for <em>thy</em> care,
O most excellent jackal!"</p>

<p>"Lawyers," says Johnson in 1777,&mdash;"lawyers
often pay women the high compliment of supposing
them proof against all temptations combined."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>Certainly, whatever the <em>lawyers</em> may do, the <em>law itself</em>
confidently expects of them a superhuman strength. It
gives them no defence but immaculateness. It offers
them no shelter but God's temple, no robe but spotless
ermine; and then, turning the page, it says, "A
<em>husband</em> is expected to be vigilant, and so prevent
his own dishonor:" as if his <em>vigilance</em> and quick-wittedness
could save the woman whom his <em>love</em>
had not blessed.</p>

<p>Ah! these lawyers are but blind guides, after all.
Centuries of discomfiture and defeat have not sufficed
to teach them how little security is to be found in
suspicion and scepticism. If I do not want my
groceries stolen, I must leave my storeroom open.
The very servant who would not scruple to pick
my locks will know better than to pick that of her
own heart. "A thorough-bred woman," says Mrs.
Reid, "is good only so far as her husband suggests
and allows;" and, so long as <em>this</em> is the standard,
woman's duplicity may well match man's utmost
expectation, and there is not a privilege of his open
vice that she will not secure by stealth.</p>

<p>There was a time when all the women at the
court of France blushed for one of their number
who unluckily made use of a hard word in a <em>proper</em>
place. In like manner, the woman who reads law
blushes to find herself even tolerably sincere and
modest. It is not expected of her. Why has she
never done any of the bad things the law so confidently
predicts?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>All thinking people must see how easily we turn
from the consolidated law of ages, with its false views,
its untrue estimate of woman and duty, to the question
of the right of suffrage.</p>

<p>In 1848 and 1850, we used to hear a great deal of
three objections to conferring this right upon women:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>1st, Its incompatibility with household care and the duties
of maternity.</p>

<p>2d, Its hardening effect on the character; politics not
being fit for woman.</p>

<p>3d, The inexpediency of increasing competition in the
already crowded fields of labor and office.</p></blockquote>

<p>To these three points we gave short and summary
answers:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>1st, There are a great many women who will never be
mothers and housekeepers; and, if there were not, suffrage
is no more incompatible with maternity and housekeeping
than it is with mercantile life and the club-room.</p>

<p>2d, If it hardens women, it will harden men; and the
politics which are not fit for her are not fit for him, nor will
they become so till her presence gives men a motive to purify
them.</p>

<p>3d, At the worst, competition could only go so far, that a
man <em>and</em> a woman would earn as little together as the man
now does alone. This would be better than the present condition
of things; for they would then be equal partners, and
no longer master and slave. Both would work, and neither
need pine.</p></blockquote>

<p>These answers, whether logical or not, have practically
silenced the objections. We hear no more of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
<em>this</em> nonsense. But, on the other hand, a respectable
daily says, "As to the abstract right of a woman to
vote because she is a human being and pays taxes,
there is no such abstract right in any human being,
male or female: the extent of the elective franchise is,
and must ever be, limited by considerations of expediency."</p>

<p>Then a distinguished review goes on to say, "that
while the question of suffrage stands where it now
does, so unsettled that every Congress and Parliament
discuss it anew, we are glad that any thing should
prevent the discussion as to conferring on woman a
duty, the grounds of which are very vague and undetermined
so far as regards men;" and a critic of
Rosa Bonheur's magnificent pictures advises the "sad
sisterhood of women's-rights advocates to visit the
exhibition, and sigh to think how much one silent
woman's hand outvalues for their cause the pathos
and the jeers of their unlovely platform."</p>

<p>Such remarks as these are easily met. To the first
objector, who declares, although the professed advocate
of a republican government, that <em>there is no such
thing</em> as any abstract right to vote, we reply, that in
this particular discussion we don't care about <em>abstract
rights</em>: what we want is our <em>own share</em> of the tangible
acknowledged right which human governments confer.
If in England this right depends on a property qualification,
then we claim that there the property qualification
shall endow woman as well as man with the
right of suffrage. If in America it depends upon an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
inalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness, then we demand that our government recognize
woman as so endowed, and receive her vote.</p>

<p>To the reviewer we say also, If the grounds of suffrage
are vague and undetermined in <em>theory</em>, they may
remain so, so far as our interference is concerned.
What we ask to share is the steady right to vote,
which has been actually granted, and never disputed,
since our government was founded; and sufficiently
pressed, we might add, that, if there is ever any
chance of limiting the right of suffrage, we shall do
all we can to secure its dependence on a certain
amount of education, in preference to a certain amount
of wealth.</p>

<p>As to the art critic, we thank him for calling us the
"sad sisterhood." We should be sorry to be otherwise,
when pleading for women <em>before</em> men; sorry to
find matter for jesting in those purlieus of St. Giles
and Five Points and the Black Sea, beating up remorselessly
against these very doors, which lie at the
very heart of our effort. As to the matter of going
to see the Horse Fair and the Highland Cattle, it will
probably be found to be a fact, that, in every city
where those great pictures have been exhibited, "<em>women's-rights
women</em>" have been their <em>earliest</em> visitors;
and, standing before the canvas, have thanked God,
with an earnestness the art critic never dreamt of, for
that silent woman's hand, that glorious woman's life.
It was not necessary for him to remind us of what
Solomon had said so much better three thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
years ago; namely, that "speech is silvern, and silence
is golden." Nathless, silver is still current in all
markets; and, God willing, we are not ashamed to
use it.</p>

<p>We intend to claim, in words, the right of suffrage;
and why?</p>

<p>Turning from that wretched estimate of woman,
and of man's duty toward woman, which the law-books
have just offered us, we claim the right of suffrage,
because only through its possession can women
protect themselves; only through its exercise can both
sexes have equality of right and power before the law.
Whenever this happened, character would get its legitimate
influence; and it is just possible that men
might become rational and virtuous in private, if
association with women compelled them to <em>seem so</em> in
public.</p>

<p>It is noticeable, that every man disclaims at his
own hearth, and in the presence of women, whatever
there is of disgraceful appertaining to political or
other public meetings. <em>Somebody</em> must be responsible
for these things; and yet, if we are to believe witnesses,
nobody ever does them. The bare fact of
association must take all the blame.</p>

<p>The laws already existing prove conclusively to
woman herself, that she has never had a real representative.
What she seeks is to utter her own convictions,
so that they shall redeem and save, not
merely her own sex but the race.</p>

<p>That the right of suffrage would be a protection to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
women, we see from this fact, that it would at once
put an end to three classes of laws:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>I. Those that protect her from violence.</p>

<p>II. Those made to protect her from fraud.</p>

<p>III. Those that protect society from the passions of
both sexes.</p></blockquote>

<p>The moment woman began to exercise this right, I
think we should see moral significance streaming from
every statute. We should no longer hear that seduction
was to be sued as "loss of service:" it would
become loss of honor to <em>more</em> than one. We should
no longer hear that consent or temptation excused it:
we should find that God demanded chastity of both
sexes, and had made man the guardian of his own
virtue. We should find, that, if its punishment admitted
of degrees, it should be <em>heaviest</em> where a
man committed it in defiance or abuse of a positive
trust.</p>

<p>Let us look at a single decision in the light of these
principles. Let us take the case of Harris <em>versus</em>
Butler, reported in the notes to Davis's Prize Essay.</p>

<p>A man named Harris had apprenticed his daughter
to a milliner named Butler, paying as an entrance-fee
a sum equivalent to a hundred and fifty dollars. After
a short time, the girl was seduced by her mistress's
husband. She became seriously ill, and was returned
to her father, who lost not only his hundred and fifty
dollars, but all the benefits of her apprenticeship, and
was obliged to provide her with board, medicine, and
nursing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>Why the father became liable for the care of his
child under such circumstances does not appear.
Common sense would suggest that the court might
have required this at the hands of the Butlers; but,
unfortunately, law has very little to do with common
sense.</p>

<p>The father brought an action against Butler: but
the defence urged, that he could only sue for "loss of
service;" that her "services" were not his after she
was apprenticed to Mrs. Butler; that Mrs. Butler and
her husband were "one person in law;" and that, if
Butler chose to deprive himself of her services for his
own ends, the law had no remonstrance to make, no
redress to afford.</p>

<p>The prosecution urged, that the "care of morals"
was one of the duties involved in the very system of
apprenticeship; but the court denied the claim, unless
it were distinctly set forth on the articles signed.</p>

<p>This is but one case out of hundreds accessible to
you all. The moment woman becomes a law-maker,
such records will be wiped out of your life. They
may make a certain sort of show in your law-books;
but what have the unbending laws of God to do with
this "one person in law," this plea for "loss of service"?
At the eternal bar, no man will dare to echo
that plea, no judge rehearse that verdict. Such law
rests not in the "bosom of God;" its voice chimes
not in keeping with the harmony of his countless
spheres.</p>

<p>You object to seeing women in Parliament. English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
lords tell us that delicate matters have to be discussed
there, with which women would hardly care to
meddle. The natural growth of society opens the
area of all proprieties. Delicate matters come to be
discussed in most households; and it is reasonable to
suppose that they would be more delicately and rationally
discussed if they were sometimes <em>publicly</em>
met. It is my opinion, that no subject is fit for discussion
at all that cannot be discussed between men
and women. It is separating the sexes in such cases,
that opens the way to indecency. All great themes
of human thought and human virtue, men and women
ought to be trained to consider seriously together;
and where better than in the Congress or the Parliament?
Think only of the debate which I have quoted
on the New Divorce Bill! Could such a scene have
taken place in the presence of women? Recur to the
trial of Queen Caroline; or to that of the Duke of
York, when accused of conniving at the corrupt
sale of military commissions by his mistress, Mrs.
Clarke.</p>

<p>Under date of Feb. 16, 1809, Freemantle writes:
"The scene which is going on in the House of Commons
is so disgusting, and at the same time so alarming,
that I hardly know how to describe it to you. Of
course, while this ferment lasts (and God knows when
it is to end), no attention will be paid to the business
of the country."</p>

<p>In these instances, high-bred men showed a taste for
low scandal; battening day after day on the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
loathsome details, which the presence of a single
woman must have checked. Here was a woman,
too, this very Mrs. Clarke, somewhat debased and
hardened, who had never a seat in Parliament, who
had never dreamed of exercising the right of suffrage,
yet was quite equal, as the evidence showed, to any
political venality, striving in her way to outdo the very
jobbers of Downing Street itself! Why <em>should</em> elections
be scenes of tumult, or parliaments free fields for
imbecile improprieties? Why should not a peeress
feel herself as properly placed among her peers as the
Queen seated at her Council?</p>

<p>We are not likely to withdraw our claim while it
is sustained by such a man as John Stuart Mill, who,
in his late essay on "Political Representation," advises
this extension of the suffrage: "All householders, without
distinction of sex," he says, "might be adopted
into the constituency, on proving to the registrar's
officer that they have fifty pounds a year, and can
read, write, and calculate."</p>

<p>"The almost despotic power of husbands over
wives," Mr. Mill adds in his "Essay on Liberty,"
"needs not to be enlarged upon here, because nothing
more is needed for the complete removal of the
evil than that wives should have the same rights, and
should receive the protection of the law in the same
manner, as all other persons; and because, on this
subject, the defenders of established injustice do not
avail themselves of the plea of liberty, but stand forth
openly as the champions of power."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>The dedication of this "Essay on Liberty" ought
to be preserved in these pages; for it is full of historic
significance:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To the beloved and deplored memory of her who was the
inspirer, and in part the author, of all that has been best in
my writings; the friend and wife, whose exalted sense of
truth and right was my strongest excitement, and whose approbation
was my chief reward,&mdash;I dedicate this volume.</p>

<p>"Like all that I have written for many years, it belongs as
much to her as to me; but the work, as it stands, has had, in
a very insufficient degree, the inestimable advantage of her
revision; some of the most important portions having been
reserved for a more careful re-examination, which they are
now never destined to receive. Were I but capable of interpreting
to the world one-half the great thoughts and
noble feelings which are buried in her grave, I should be the
medium of a greater benefit to it than is ever likely to arise
from any thing that I can write, unprompted and unassisted
by her all but unrivalled wisdom."</p></blockquote>

<p>I said that this dedication ought, for many reasons,
to be preserved in these pages. What is better fitted
than such a tribute to check the jeering scepticism of
the crowd as to the ability and purity of the sex?
What could lay a better foundation for a better estimate
on the part of the law? Necker, in his report
to the French Government, publicly awarded to his
wife the credit of the recent retrenchment in the expenses
of the Government; Bowditch dedicated his
translation of the "Mécanique Céleste" to the wife
who aided him to prepare, and by her self-denial
opened a way for him to publish it: but where, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
the records of the past, shall we find such a tribute
offered by such a man, as honorable in itself to the
first political economist of our time as it is a gracious
adornment to the name of the woman he loved?
Does it not promise in itself the dawning of a brighter
future for woman, when no "sad sisterhood" shall be
needed either to proclaim woman's rights or redress
her wrongs?<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>About two years since (1858), the Stockholm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
"Aftonblad," a Swedish newspaper, stated that "the
authorities of the old university-town of Upsal had
granted the right of suffrage to fifty women owning
real estate, and to thirty-one doing business on their
own account. The representative that their votes
assisted in electing was to sit in the House of Burgesses."</p>

<p>This is the way the matter is to begin. By and by,
the interests of labor and trade will force the authorities
of Bristol and Manchester, Newcastle and Plymouth,
to do the same thing; and, after women have
gone on for some twenty years electing members of
Parliament, no one of us will be surprised to find some
women sitting in that body. "But," objects somebody,
"if that ever happens, we shall have women on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
juries, women pleading at the bar, women as attorneys,
and so on." And this is exactly what we want.
Women are very much <em>needed</em> on juries, and <em>female</em>
criminals will never be tried by their peers until they
are there. It is very seldom that a criminal case in
which women are implicated is brought forward, when
women could not be of immense service in clearing
up evidence, and showing to the male jurors on the
panel the absurdity or impossibility of some of the
statements. The recent instance of Miss Shedden,
who took up, at a moment's notice, a case which five
well-feed lawyers of distinction declared themselves
unprepared to defend, might be quoted in confirmation
of our view. Mr. Russell said at the Liverpool
Assizes lately, in a case which involved some peculiar
evidence, "The evidence of women is, in some respects,
superior to that of men. Their power of
judging of minute details is better; and when there
are more than two facts, and something be wanting,
their intuitions supply the deficiency." And precisely
the qualities which fit them to give evidence, fit them
to sift and test it. Women often have occasion to
smile, sometimes sadly, sometimes mischievously, at
the verdicts passed upon their own sex. If women
were to enter into the practice of law, or become law-makers,
an immense change would take place in all
that relates to it. Absurd technicalities would be
swept off its papers. One hundred words would no
longer do duty for one. Simple, common-sense forms
of expression would take the place of obsolete Latin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
and Norman-French. Daylight would be let into indictments,
and flaws would soon be hard to find. No
woman ever existed, whose patience would stand, in
cases where meaning and law are evident, the absurd
delays of chancery courts, or the still absurder "filing
of objections," or "defining of terms," with which lawyers
amuse a jury, and which Sir Leicester Dedlock,
we are told, considered as the bulwarks of the English
Constitution. This impatience of woman might not
be very valuable, if she were to legislate alone; but,
controlled by man's conservative caution, it will be of
the greatest service.</p>

<p>We are perpetually met by the opposition extended
to <em>any thing</em> that is new. It ought to be our object,
therefore, to show, that for woman to claim and possess
the right of suffrage is by no means a new thing.
It is easy to show from the records of most nations,
that women held and exercised political power so
long as power was supposed to inhere <em>chiefly</em> in property,
and so long as women, either single or in association,
possessed property not represented by men.
Thus the suppression of religious houses in England
put an end to the representation of abbesses. "Truly,
we think more of money than of love," said one of
the St. Simoniens: "we have more consideration for
bags of dollars than human dignity. We emancipate
women in proportion as they are property-holders;
but, in proportion as they are women, our laws
declare them inferior to us." It was only when the
republican idea had crept to a certain extent into monarchical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
governments themselves, that women gradually
dropped a recognized public influence which had
depended on rank and wealth. What men have to
do is, not to reconcile themselves to a woman's right
to vote,&mdash;a right acknowledged hundreds of years
ago, which is still covertly acknowledged when woman
means property,&mdash;but to reconcile themselves
to the idea that woman is a human being, and that
<em>humanity</em> has a right to vote. Wherever governments
decide that every individual has a right to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, they must admit
the right of the individual woman to vote, or
deny the fact of her humanity. There is the dilemma.
In support of this statement, I should have
shown you, that in France, as early as the reign of
Louis XIV., the political rights of property were respected
in the persons of women. At the present
day, the remains of the old feudal and communal
system still secure a kind of political influence to certain
women in the provinces, and often confer upon
their husbands a right of franchise. In the reign of
Louis XIV., the women who hawked and vended
fish took up the business of the "insolvent fishmongers,"
and managed so well, that they acquired
wealth, married their children into the first families,
and finally became an estate of the realm.</p>

<p>"Les Dames de la Halle," or "Dames of the Market,"
as they are called, have a corporate existence;
and, if corporations have no souls, they ordinarily possess
<em>franchises</em>! They have their queen, their laws,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
and a language peculiar to themselves. They take
part in revolutions, and send deputations to the foot
of the throne. Nor am I alluding now to long-past
feudal or re-actionary crises. Louis Napoleon treats
them as civilly as he does the clergy. When he was
married, and when the young prince was born, they
went to the Tuileries in their court-dress. Their
princesses&mdash;and we are told that their blood-royal
claims the higher privilege of beauty also&mdash;their
princesses took the front rank in the procession, and
offered bouquets to their imperial majesties. In response,
Louis Napoleon gave to them what he gives
to all corporations,&mdash;a very diplomatic speech.</p>

<p>I have told you what was granted at Upsal in
1858. It is a curious fact, that, just at the moment
when this question of suffrage was first agitated by
the women of the United States assembled in convention
at Seneca Falls in 1848, Pauline Roland and
Madame Moniot publicly claimed their civil rights in
Paris. Pauline went herself to the ballot, and, when
her vote was refused, published a protest after the
fashion of our tax-payers. Very absurd English society
found woman's first demand for the suffrage;
yet what Englishmen refuse contemptuously to <em>give
to</em> woman, certain men of the mean sort, yet calling
themselves respectable, have not been ashamed in
that very country to <em>borrow of</em> her. Even "Blackwood"
helps out our argument, when it says, in
November, 1854, "I believe, Eusebius, I speak of a
notorious fact, when I say, that it is less than a century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
since, for election purposes, parties were unblushingly
married in cases where <em>women</em> conveyed a
right of freedom, a political franchise to their husbands,
and parted, after the election, by shaking hands
over a tombstone, as an act of dissolution of the contract,
under cover of the words, 'Until death do us
part.'"<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The men who looked calmly on this profane
and absurd fraud may well dread the moral influence
of woman on elections. As to the historical
argument for England, ladies of birth and quality,
we are told, sat in council with the Saxon Witas.
The Abbess Hilda <em>presided</em> in an ecclesiastical council.
"In Wightfred's great council at Benconceld in
694," says Gurdon in his "Antiquities of Parliament,"
"the abbesses sat and deliberated; and five of them
signed decrees of that council, with the king and
bishops:" and that illuminated prebendary of Sarum,
old Thomas Fuller, thus further chronicles the same
event:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A great council (for so it is titled) was held at Becanceld
(supposed to be Beckingham in Kent) by Withred, King of
Kent, and Bertuald, Archbishop of Britain, so called therein
(understand, him of Canterbury), wherein many things were
concluded in favor of the church. Five Kentish abbesses&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>namely,
Mildred, Ethelred, Æte, Wilnolde, Heresinde&mdash;were
not only present, but subscribed their names and crosses to
the constitutions concluded therein; and we may observe,
that their subscriptions are not only placed before and above
all presbyters, but also above that of Botred, a bishop present
in this great council. It seems it was the courtesy of
England to allow the upper hand to the weaker sex, as in
their sitting, so in their subscription."</p></blockquote>

<p>King Edgar's charter to the Abbey of Crowland, in
961, was with consent of the nobles and <em>abbesses</em> who
signed that charter. In Henry the Third's and King
Edward the First's time, four abbesses were summoned
to Parliament; namely, of Shaftesbury, of
Winchester, of Berking, and of Wilton. In the
thirty-fifth year of Edward the Third, were summoned&mdash;by
writ of Parliament, to sit in person or
by their proxies&mdash;Mary, Countess of Norfolk; Alienor,
Countess of Ormond; Anna Despenser; Philippa,
Countess of March; Johanna Fitzwater; Agneta,
Countess of Pembroke; Mary de St. Paul; Mary de
Roos; Matilda, Countess of Oxford; Catharine,
Countess of Athol.</p>

<p>As to the offices which women can hold in Great
Britain, we have already quoted something from Mr.
Higginson, in speaking of the prohibitions of the law.
Lady Packington's estate has probably, by this time,
passed into male hands: so <em>she</em> elects no more members
of Parliament. Those who have read the plea
of Lady Alice Lille, when she was forbidden to speak
by attorney, will find no great difficulty in imagining
that a woman could manage a government debate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>Such women as have purchased or inherited East-India
stock have always had the privilege of voting
at the meetings of the company, and so have assisted
to govern that unhappy country. In the provincial
English towns, if I may judge from the indirect testimony
of novels and newspapers, women appear to
attend all stockholders' meetings; certainly those held
by the banks. In the United States, they are notified,
<em>but not expected to attend</em>; a cool kind of insult, which
I wish some women might astonish them by retaliating.
If any bank were established by, or had a majority
of, female stockholders, it would be quite easy
to notify men, without expecting <em>them</em> to attend; and
the alternative of trusting their own property to the
judgment of <em>women</em> might possibly open the eyes of
men to the absurdity of the present custom.</p>

<p>As we withdraw our eyes from the past, it is natural
to inquire, What late changes have taken place
in Great Britain? and what is the strength of the
reform tendency? I have often said, yet I must repeat
it here, that nothing has ever promised such noble
usefulness for woman, nothing has ever occurred
to change the popular estimate of her character, in
the same degree as the formation of that <em>out-of-door
Parliament</em>,&mdash;the Association for the Advancement
of Social Science. It offers a position of entire
equality to woman. It encourages her to express herself
in the presence and with the sympathy of the
wisest men, and gives her an opportunity to speak to
the actual Parliament through her own influence exerted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
on its best members. It has been well said (I
think, by Mrs. Mill), that the very best opportunities
of education will be opened to woman in vain, until
she is practically invited to turn them to account.
Here, in this association, is her first practical invitation
in Great Britain. God grant that she may understand
the responsibility it involves, and bear it
well! But the formation of this association in 1857
was preceded by other steps. It was on the 13th of
February, 1851, that a petition of women, agreed to
by a public meeting at Sheffield, and claiming the
elective franchise, was laid before the House of Lords
by the Earl of Carlisle; and, in July of the same year,
Mrs. Mill's admirable article on the "Enfranchisement
of Women," now become commonplace on account of
the extensive and thorough use that has been made
of it, appeared in the "Westminster."</p>

<p>The examination of Florence Nightingale before a
commission of inquiry bore witness no less to the
surpassing ability of the woman than to the increasing
value of such ability to all governments. In connection
with it, one could not but smile at the distress
felt by certain journals over a single mistake on the
part of the lady as to the proper title of a subordinate
officer.</p>

<p>In the month of March, 1856, the "London Times"
published a petition to both Houses of Parliament in
behalf of an amendment of the English property-laws.
This petition was signed by many women whose
names are well known and dear to us,&mdash;by the late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
Anna Jameson, so well known to the world as an
accomplished critic in literature and art; by the wife
and sister of the poet Browning,&mdash;Elizabeth Browning,
herself the first poet among women, so far; by
Bessie Raynor Parkes and Matilda Hayes, the editors
of the "Englishwoman's Journal," the establishment
of which of itself constitutes an era in the progress of
human thought; by Barbara Bodichon, the well-known
artist; by Harriet Martineau, distinguished in
political economy; by Mary Howitt, the womanly
story-teller and ballad-maker; and Mrs. Gaskell, the
author of "Mary Barton." The petition was supported
in the House of Lords by Lord Brougham,
and in the House of Commons by Sir Erskine Perry.</p>

<p>After the close of the session in April, 1857, a
dinner was offered to Lord Brougham in acknowledgment
of the distinguished ardor with which he
had pressed this bill,&mdash;the Married Woman's Property
Act of 1857. This bill did not apply to Ireland
or Scotland, nor to pre-existing contracts; that is, to
marriages solemnized before the first day of January,
1858. It was not passed; but a clause for the protection
of the earnings and savings of married women
was introduced into the New Divorce Bill, and has
already proved a blessing to hundreds. This clause,
however, operates <em>only</em> in cases of desertion,&mdash;a
charge easily evaded.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>The New Divorce Bill passed in 1858: the Divorce
and Matrimonial Causes Act Amendment Bill passed
in July, 1858; and since then, the Divorce Court Bill
in August, 1859; both of these last having been
made necessary by the first change in the law. It
was in April, 1858, that Mr. Buckle delivered his
lecture on "Civilization;" an important contribution
to that estimate of woman, which is beginning to act
powerfully on all legislation. The Law-Amendment
Society also published a report, urging a thorough
reform of the law.</p>

<p>In connection with the reforms effected in the
mother-country, it may be well to state, that similar
reforms are being effected in Canada. Legislators
there turn for their precedents to England; but there
can be no doubt that the agitation in the United
States largely contributes towards these changes.</p>

<p>A Married Woman's Property Act passed the
Council in May, 1858; but as these changes are
still in progress, and a progress much interrupted by
political fluctuations, it seems hardly worth while to
enter into their details.</p>

<p>In one respect, the statutes of Canada are marked
by a singular inconsistency. They record the only
instance, within my knowledge, in which a government
distinctly <em>forbids</em> women to vote; and almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
the only instance of a government <em>conferring</em> that
right, even to a limited extent. In the twelfth year
of Victoria, the Canadian Government passed a statute
in these words: "No woman is or <em>shall be</em> entitled
to vote at any election for any electoral division
whatever." What spasm of autocratic terror, what
momentary rebellion against their liege lady, inspired
this act, we are left uninformed. For the most part,
in all countries, women wait to be told that they <em>may
vote</em>; and their ineligibility is decided by the introduction
of the word "male," or the popular construction
of the word "citizen," which, it is quite evident,
does not mean a woman. But it was in Canada also
that a distinct electoral privilege was conferred by
intention in 1850; an intention, however, which indicated
no enlargement of views, nor desire of reform,
nor recognition of woman at her human value: it
was simply an intention on the part of the Protestants
to secure a little more political power. Not <em>humane</em>,
then, but interested motives dictated the omission of
the word "male" in that section of the statutes which
provides for the election of school trustees. It was
desired thus to bring the influence of female property-holders
and Protestants to check the Roman-Catholic
demand for separate schools. Three things made it
easy for Canadian women to vote under this provision:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>1st, The great degree of individual independence
seen everywhere in English-born women, as compared
with American.</p>

<p>2d, The respect felt, in all countries where distinctions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
of rank exist, for the mere property-holder.</p>

<p>3d, The political excitement of the local Protestant
Church, which sustained them to the uttermost.</p></blockquote>

<p>They have voted for ten years; and a four-years'
residence among them was sufficient to convince me,
that no greater derangement to society would occur
if the full right were conferred. In connection with
English government and English colonies, I ought to
speak of the government of Pitcairn's Island. It was
the mutinous crew of his majesty's ship "Bounty"
that settled Pitcairn's Island. Adams, the boatswain,
was the father of the little community, and drew up
the simple code of laws by which the islanders are
still governed. On Christmas Day, a magistrate and
councillor are elected for the ensuing year; men
and women over sixteen being allowed to vote. The
women assist in the cultivation of the ground, and
take no inconsiderable share in the municipal debates.
The fate of this experiment is not yet decided; so I
have thought it worth while to preserve the statement.
You will have already seen, that in England, as elsewhere,
so long as the right of suffrage depended upon
possession of property, upon hard pieces of eight, or
broad acres of land, there was no dispute of woman's
privilege. It is no new thing for woman to vote in
England: it is a very <em>old</em> thing. It is only a question
whether she shall vote upon the ground of her
humanity.</p>

<h2>III.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THE UNITED-STATES LAW, AND SOME THOUGHTS ON
HUMAN RIGHTS.</strong></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Men often think to bring about great results by violent and unprepared
effort; but it is only in fair and forecast order, 'as the earth bringeth
forth her bud,' that righteousness and praise may spring forth before
the nations."&mdash;<span class="smcap">John Ruskin.</span></p></blockquote>


<p class="dropcap">IN passing last to the United States of America,
one is tempted to ask, with Anna Brewster when
rehearsing the hardships of Helvetian women, "Can
it be true, as the advocates of despotic government
often say, that under no government are women so
harshly treated, so stripped of all independent rights,
as under a republic? In republican Helvetia, the
Vaudois peasant woman leaves all household care, to
stand, spring, summer, and autumn, in her vineyard;
but not a bunch of grapes can she gather for the
market, without her husband's leave. <em>He</em> may have
loitered and smoked through every sunny day, while
<em>she</em> has dug and dressed and watered; but she may
not sell one grape to buy bread for her children."</p>

<p>And this is a picturesque statement of the English
common law, on which the common law of the
United States still rests in the main, and on which it
has rested entirely until within the last ten years.</p>

<p>A few passages from Chancellor Kent will indicate,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>I. The estimate of woman formed by this law, and
the property-laws built upon this estimate.</p>

<p>II. The laws which regulate divorce. We shall
have to consider,&mdash;</p>

<p>III. Woman's general civil position; and,&mdash;</p>

<p>IV. The right of suffrage.</p></blockquote>

<p>Fortunately for us, Chancellor Kent talks plain
English. He tells us exactly what the law means,
and sets it forth as if it were written to be understood;
which is not exactly the case with all his
predecessors.</p>

<p>As to the estimate of woman on which the laws
are based, we have, in connection with what we have
already quoted from English law-books, the following
statement:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"But as the husband is the guardian of the wife, and bound
to protect and maintain her, the law has given him a reasonable
superiority and control over her person; and he may even
put gentle restraints upon her liberty, if her conduct be such
as to require it. The husband is the best judge of the wants
of the family, and the means of supplying them; and, if he
shifts his domicile, the wife is bound to follow him."&mdash;<cite>Kent's
Commentaries</cite>, vol. ii. p. 180.</p></blockquote>

<p>The best comment on this is found, I think, in a
story told by Mrs. Stowe, who says that she once saw
a little hut perched on a barren ledge of the Alps, out
of reach of human help, and without pasture; but a
little below it were stretches of sweet Alpine grass,
inviting to eye and foot, and capable of affording sustenance
to goats and sheep. "How long have you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
lived here?" asked Mrs. Stowe of the old woman.
"Above forty years."&mdash;"And what made you come
so far up? Don't you like the meadow?"&mdash;"I don't
know," was the reply: "it was the <em>man's notion</em>."</p>

<p>It is somewhat questionable, whether this man
<em>would</em> be the best judge of the wants of his family,
Chancellor Kent to the contrary notwithstanding; as
also what might be his idea of "gentle restraint," in
case the wife had refused "to shift her domicile." As
to property, Kent proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<p>The general rule is, that the husband becomes entitled,
on the marriage, to all the goods and chattels of
the wife, and to the rents and profits of her lands;
and he becomes liable to pay her debts and perform
her contracts.</p>

<blockquote><p>1. If the wife have an inheritance in land, he takes
the rents and profits during their joint lives. He
may sue in his own name for an injury to the profits
of the land; but, if the husband himself chooses to
commit waste, the wife has no redress at common
law.</p>

<p>2. If the wife, at the time of her marriage, hath an
estate for her life, the husband becomes seized of
such an estate, and is entitled to the profits during
marriage.</p>

<p>3. The husband also becomes possessed of the
chattels real of the wife; and the law gives him
power, <em>without her consent</em>, to sell, assign, mortgage,
or otherwise dispose of, the same as he pleases.
Such chattels real are liable to be sold on execution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
for his debts (vol. ii. p. 133). If he survive his wife,
the law gives him her chattels real by survivorship.</p>

<p>4. If debts are due to the wife before marriage,
and are recovered by the husband afterward, the
money becomes, in most cases, absolutely his own.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, the husband is,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>1st, Obliged to provide for his wife out of his fortune,
or her own that he has taken into his custody,
of what the court calls "necessaries,"&mdash;these again,
of course, to be dependent on the "<em>man's notion</em>"!
and,&mdash;</p>

<p>2d, Becomes liable for her frauds and torts during
coverture,&mdash;the law understanding, as well as a merchant,
that it is useless to "sue a broken bench."</p></blockquote>

<p>The <em>indulgence</em> of the law toward the wife, we are
then told, is founded on the idea of force exercised
by the husband; a presumption only, which may be
repelled. What this indulgence is, we may well be
puzzled to guess, unless the phrase indicate that she
is not to be prosecuted for theft, where <em>both</em> are guilty;
and yet, if the presumption that he compelled her to
steal be <em>repelled</em>, she <em>may</em> be prosecuted, and found
guilty.</p>

<p>A wife cannot devise her lands by will; nor can she
make a testament of chattels, except it be of those
which she holds <i xml:lang="Fr">en autre droit</i>, without the license of
her husband. It is not strictly a will, then, only an
appointment, which the husband is bound to allow
(vol. ii. p. 170).</p>

<p>The laws are essentially the same in Pennsylvania,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky,
and New York; in the latter State, of course, only
as applicable to marriages contracted before the passage
of the new bill. It is the same in all the States,
with one or two Western exceptions; because the
passage of a new law never annuls <em>pre-existing</em> contracts.
In consequence, practice becomes contradictory
and intricate; and most lawyers not only <em>feel</em>,
but <em>show</em>, a great dislike to new laws on that account.</p>

<p>In regard to marriage and divorce, Kent says that
the English practice was, not to grant divorce for
unfaithfulness on the part of the <em>husband</em>; and the
early settlers of Massachusetts made the same distinction,
creating a difference at the very outset in the
moral responsibility of the two, fatal alike to happiness
and civilization.</p>

<p>In 1840, the policy of South Carolina continued so
strict, that there had been no instance, since the Revolution,
of a divorce pronounced by a court of justice,
or an act of the legislature.</p>

<p>In Massachusetts, the law was, that divorce could
only be had for criminality. In Vermont, New Jersey,
Kentucky, Mississippi, and Michigan, divorce from
"bed and board" may be had for extreme cruelty;
and, in Michigan, for wilful desertion for three
years.</p>

<p>In Indiana, it is rendered for any cause, at the judgment
of the court.</p>

<p>In Illinois, divorce may be had for the usual causes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
and for drunkenness or cruelty, or such other cause as
the court shall think right; and, in such cases, the
wife does not lose her dower. These differences in
statute law indicate, one would think, a variety sufficient
to test in time all the theories of reformers and
experimentalists.</p>

<p>As to the consistency of the law, Poynter says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"It is singular to see a marriage <em>annulled</em> on account of
the misspelling or suppressing of a name, which would be
held <em>valid</em> against the lasting misery of the parties."</p></blockquote>

<p>By cruelty is meant "reasonable apprehension of
bodily hurt." Mere austerity of temper, petulance
of manners, rudeness of language, a want of civil
attention, even <em>occasional</em> sallies of passion, do not
amount to that cruelty which the law can relieve.
The wife must disarm her husband by the <em>weapons of
kindness</em>!</p>

<p>I have shown you upon what estimate the general
common law of the United States is based, as regards
both property and divorce. It is needless to say that
this estimate is very little to be preferred to that of
older countries; but, when the reformers of our cause
are tauntingly asked what good they have done, they
may reply proudly, though they should point to the
changes of legislation during the last ten years alone.
Since 1850, the laws have been changed in at least
nineteen States. The credit of this change should
certainly rest with the men and women of this reform;
for, in every State, its sympathizing friends helped to
frame the new laws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether justly or not, Rhode Island claims the
honor of leading the way in such changes. In 1844,
the Hon. Wilkins Updike introduced a bill into her
legislature, securing to married women their property
under certain regulations. The step was in the right
direction. In 1847, Vermont passed similar enactments.
In 1848-9, Connecticut, New York, and
Texas followed; in 1850, Alabama; in 1853, New
Hampshire. In 1855, Massachusetts passed an act
of a still more comprehensive kind. It was essentially
the same as that introduced into her Senate, in 1852,
by the Hon. S.E. Sewall. It was not wholly satisfactory
to those who prepared it, but was the best it
was thought possible to pass.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> In 1856 and 1857,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>the Legislatures of Kentucky, Missouri, Indiana,
Ohio, Rhode Island, and Maine, altered their property-laws,&mdash;Rhode
Island advancing somewhat on her
first step.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Wisconsin and Iowa have followed; and
it is not likely that any new States, unless they should
be slave States, will repeat the old barbarisms.</p>

<p>I have given Rhode Island the precedence she
claims; but there are certain statutes of the State
of Illinois, as early in date as January, 1829, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
deserve to be alluded to, on account of their unusual
liberality.</p>

<p>If married, and over the age of eighteen years, a
woman in Illinois may, <em>in spite</em> of her husband, devise
her real estate, and bequeath her personal estate,
to any one for ever.</p>

<p>The wife may administer on her deceased husband's
estate, in preference to all others, if she apply within
sixty days. On her husband's death, she inherits one-half
of his real estate in fee-simple, absolute; and the
whole of his personal estate, with her rights of dower
in addition.</p>

<p>The wife has not <em>legally</em> the first title to the guardianship
of her child on the demise of her husband;
but she has it by a kind of <em>comity</em>, the consent of public
opinion and the courts.</p>

<p>In reference to the wife's inheriting from the husband,
my correspondent, the Hon. William H. Herndon,
says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"You will perceive a difference in the two sections relating
to the wife and husband as inheriting from one another, favorable
to the wife apparently. In the twenty-second section
you will find, that, in case of the wife's death without children,
the husband inherits one-half of her real estate in fee-simple,
absolute; but nothing is said about her personal.
This is because the common law has already given him her
personal estate on her marriage."</p></blockquote>

<p>So we see that the State of Illinois did not quite
divest itself of the barbarisms of the common law.</p>

<p>In a later letter, Mr. Herndon continues:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>"Our Illinois Legislature has this winter (1860-61)
enacted a law, allowing women (married women) all their
property,&mdash;real, personal, mixed,&mdash;free from all debt, contract,
obligation, and control of their husbands. This law
puts man and woman in the same position, as far as property-rights
and their remedies are concerned. This is right,&mdash;just
as it should be. For my life, I cannot see why there
should be any distinction between men and women, when we
speak of rights under government. A woman's rights are
identical with a man's. Where he is limited, she should
be; where she is limited, he should be."</p></blockquote>

<p>In Rhode Island, the civil existence of the husband
and wife is but one; and, though the letter of the
law considers her property acquired by trade or inheritance
as technically her own, still it is no longer
under her single control. If, as a wife, she sells merchandise,
the buyer becomes a debtor to her <em>husband
and herself</em>. If she makes a purchase, her note is good
for nothing, unless her husband's signature is affixed
to it. He can dispose of the whole of her personal
estate, unless the buyer has been previously notified
by <em>her</em>, in writing, that the property is exclusively her
own. Her real estate the husband cannot sell: but
<em>even of this</em> she cannot dispose by will; so, perhaps,
it might as well be sold. The absurdity becomes
ludicrous, when we remember that the law makes her
competent to devise any number of millions, so long
as it is invested in bank-stock or merchandise.</p>

<p>In the State of Vermont, there are three peculiar
provisions:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><em>First</em>, If the husband abscond without making sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
provision for his wife, she is <em>permitted</em> (!) to use
her own property and earnings, or the earnings of
her minor children, to secure a support. This <em>permission</em>
indicates the tender mercies of the common law,
and reminds us of the Helvetian peasant-woman.</p>

<p><em>Second</em>, She is exempted from personal restraint
during the pendency of a divorce suit.</p>

<p><em>Third</em>, A mother and her illegitimate child may
inherit from each other.</p></blockquote>

<p>A married woman may devise her real estate, and
it is exempt from attachment for the sole debts of her
husband. She may have her husband's life insured,
the insurance to be made payable to her or her children.
If he should be put into the penitentiary, she
may transact business as if she were a <em>feme sole</em>.</p>

<p>The laws of inheritance are liberal; and the common
law prevails by statute, when not repugnant to
any recorded statute.</p>

<p>In Connecticut, in 1855, all the real estate owned
at the time of marriage, or subsequently inherited by
the wife, rests absolutely in her. All her personal
estate passes to her husband; but all that she may
afterward receive remains in her right, her husband
being only her legal trustee. Her earnings are subject
to his trusteeship, and nothing more. She is the
guardian of her own children; and the court always
confirms this right, unless she is incapacitated. In
case of divorce, the father is entitled to the children,
unless objection is made. On the decease of the husband
childless, one-half of his personal estate goes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
the wife, and a life-interest in one-third of the real;
or the whole, if it be needed for her support.</p>

<p>In New Hampshire, the common law prevails for
the most part. What express enactments she passed
in 1853 seem to refer rather to making the position of
a deserted wife equivalent to that of a <em>feme sole</em> than
any thing else.</p>

<p>As regards Massachusetts, it is common to say that
the legislation of 1855 leaves very little to be desired,
beside the right of suffrage; but a keen eye still detects
more than one shortcoming. The custody of the
wife's person still vests in the husband.</p>

<p>With reference to the guardianship of children, the
custom is in advance of the law; while her power to
make a will is so carefully guarded, that it might as
well be surrendered.</p>

<p>A married woman in Massachusetts can make no
contract to bind her, except one strictly relating to her
trade, business, or property. She cannot, for instance,
indorse a note, or be a surety for another person in
any way.</p>

<p>In Maine, since 1857, a wife may hold the wages
of her own labor.</p>

<p>In Ohio, at the same date, the law gave this right
only <em>under conditions</em>. Long before any such changes
took place, however, the current of public opinion
often forced courts to decide against the common law,
and in accordance with equity,&mdash;equity not technically,
but divinely, considered.</p>

<p>Judge Graham, of the Court of Common Pleas in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
Perry County, Penn., made such a decision in a suit
where a wife claimed return of earnings loaned by her
to her husband, and accumulated <em>after</em> marriage.
The legal question brought before Judge Graham
was, "Can a wife maintain a suit against her husband?"
He decided that she could legally hold him
to a contract of the kind under consideration; and a
verdict was rendered for the woman, in the sum of
$2,508.</p>

<p>In August, 1859, Mrs. Dorr put in a claim for
$40,000 on her husband's estate, in the Court of
Insolvency in Worcester County. The court objected
to entertaining the claim until after the choice of an
assignee. The hearing was never completed; some
private adjustment taking its place. The claim was
said to be the first of the kind in the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>We come now to the consideration of the Property
Bill, passed in the spring of 1860 by the State of
New York. Not only as the latest act of specific
legislation, but as the most complete provision ever
made by any government to outwit the common law,
it demands our attention. After it was passed, a deficiency
relating to the rights of guardianship was
discovered, and a supplement was added. By these
two acts, the "New-York Tribune" tells us that
at least five thousand women in that State are
redeemed from pauperism, and established in peaceful
homes.</p>

<p>But the supplement bears on one important point,
which should be alluded to. According to the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
law, as I showed in referring to England, a
daughter owes service <em>only</em> to her father. The mother,
who bore and nursed her; who has trained her up,
it may be by painful sacrifices, to habits of propriety
and thrift,&mdash;has no claim upon her service, even in
her minority. By conferring on the mother, in case
of the father's decease, all the rights, remedies, privileges,
and responsibilities in law appertaining to the
father, the new act meets the difficulty.</p>

<p>Before quitting the subject, we cannot refrain from
alluding to the fact, that, as early as 1849, the State
of New York had passed a qualified measure in regard
to property; and directing your attention to the
manifest truth, that every imperfect act of legislation
constitutes a new set of exceptions to general rules,
and very undesirably complicates legal practice.</p>

<p>If reforms are not to be unpopular, they should be
simple and complete.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>In commenting on the passage of these bills, advocated
by Mrs. Stanton before the committees of the
Assembly and the Senate, the "New-York Tribune"
says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Mrs. Stanton talked forcibly. It is needless for me to say
that she talked earnestly of woman's sufferings, sweetly of
her endurance, eloquently of her rights. When she talked
of her right to be protected in the enjoyment of her property,
of her right to be released from the bondage of an ill-assorted
marriage, she was listened to with marked favor.
She pleaded these demands with the feeling of a true woman;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
and she carried the conviction, that she was not asking more
than policy, as well as justice, demanded should be conceded.
When she claimed that her voice should be heard on the hustings,
and her vote be received at the ballot-box, she was
earnest and eloquent and <em>plausible</em>; but she must have felt
that she was not convincing her audience, and she did not."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here the single word <em>plausible</em> vitiates, as cunning
reporters well know how to do, the whole effect of the
sentence. Far more reasonably, the "Tribune" might
have said she was earnest, eloquent, and <em>sensible</em>; and
so have spurred its readers to thought instead of ridicule.
His criticism, however, launches fairly our last
subject of discussion. It is needless to say, that nowhere
in the United States has woman the full power
of suffrage.</p>

<p>In New Jersey, women formerly possessed, and often
exercised, this right. By the Constitution, adopted
July 2, 1776, the privilege of voting was accorded to
all inhabitants, of full age and clear estate, who had
resided for a certain time in the country, and who
had fifty dollars in proclamation-money.</p>

<p>In 1790, a Quaker member of the Assembly had
the act so drawn as to read "he or she." Until 1807,
women often voted, especially in times of great political
excitement; at such times, for the most part,
"under influence," we may presume. Many voted in
the presidential contest of 1800; and a newspaper of
that period thanks them for unanimously supporting
John Adams in opposition to Jefferson. So they
were supposed, at times, to act independently. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
an election in Hunterdon County in 1802, the ballots
of some colored women elected a member of the legislature.
Probably this fact, by stimulating the local
prejudice against color, and the fading-out of all aristocratic
distinctions, which left no property qualifications
on the statute-book, led to a change; for, in
1807, an act was passed, limiting the right of suffrage
to "free white male citizens of twenty-one years."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>In later times, committees of intelligent men, in
Wisconsin, Michigan, and Ohio, have reported in favor
of granting to women the right of suffrage; but
the question was lost in the ballot which followed.</p>

<p>If the constitution prepared for Kansas should be
accepted by the people, single women will be empowered
to vote there. In Nebraska, the lower house
passed a vote, conferring the privilege; but it was too
late in the session for the question to come before the
upper branch.</p>

<p>In 1858, a proposition to amend the Constitution
of the State of Connecticut, so as to extend the
franchise to women, received eighty-two votes in the
House of Representatives. It was defeated by a majority
of forty-five. In 1852, the Kentucky Legislature,
in providing for the election of school-trustees,
enacted that "any widow, having a child between
six and eighteen years, may vote in person or by
proxy."</p>

<p>A provision thus limited by public opinion and
prejudice would probably have very little force. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
have understood that such a provision has taken
effect in some parts of Michigan, and it has also been
recommended to the State of Massachusetts. Very
early in the history of our government, its inconsistencies
became a matter of comment among women
themselves. How could it be otherwise? How can
she be said to have a right to <em>life</em>, who has never consented
to the laws which may deprive her of it, who
is steadily refused a trial by her peers, who has no
voice in the election of her judges? How can she be
said to have a right to <em>liberty</em>, whose person, if not
yet in custody, almost inevitably becomes so on her
maturity, who does not own her earnings, who can
make no valid contract, and is taxed without representation?
How can that woman be said to possess
either the right or the reality of <em>happiness</em>, who is
deprived of the custody of her own person, of the
guardianship of her children, of the right to devise or
share her property?</p>

<p>The government is tyrannical which leaves a single
citizen in this predicament. What is to be said of a
government which enforces it upon half its subjects?</p>

<p>It is not strange then, that, half in jest, half in
earnest, the wife of John Adams wrote to him in
1776 to ask if it "were generous in American men to
claim absolute power over wives at a moment when
they were emancipating the whole earth." Nor was
it strange, that, in a more serious mood, Hannah
Corbin of Virginia should write to her brother, Richard
Henry Lee, on the same subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>The American Colonies were struggling against
the mother-country, on the ground that taxation and
representation should be inseparable.</p>

<p>The "National Intelligencer" has to confess, when
it tells the story, that it was not strange if "strong-minded"
women of that era, finding themselves <em>taxed</em>,
should wonder why they could not vote.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee wrote from Chantilly in reply, March 17,
1778:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I do not see," he says, "that any thing prevents widows,
having large property, from voting, notwithstanding it has
never been the case either here or in England. Perhaps it
was thought unbecoming for women to press into tumultuous
assemblies.... Perhaps it was thought, that, as all those
who vote for taxes must bear the tax, none would be imposed,
except for the public good.</p>

<p>"For both the widow and the single woman," he continues,
"I have the highest respect; and would, at any time, give
my consent to secure to them the franchise, though I do not
think it would increase their security.</p></blockquote>

<p>"The Committee of Taxation," he adds, "are regularly
chosen by the freeholders and housekeepers; and, in the
choice of them, you have as legal a right to vote as any
person."</p>

<p>Mr. Lee thinks, that, in a few minutes' conversation,
he could "content" his sister upon the subject; but
eighty years have passed away, and the question is
still unsettled.</p>

<p>What he calls a "woman's security" is proved to
be no security, even in the small matter of money;
for men are constantly imposing taxes, the burden of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
which <em>they</em> are never to bear. As I have shown, in
treating of labor, what position women hold toward
the State in the matter of employment, I will not
repeat the statement here. Let these pages bear no
other burden than that of woman's civil rights,&mdash;"woman's
rights,"&mdash;a phrase which we <em>all</em> hate;
which soils the lips that use it; which women speak
with such unction as a slave might clank his chains!</p>

<p>Soil the lips? Not because it is a phrase which
stirs the ridicule and the contempt of the weak-minded;
not because <em>you</em> consider it only the second
term of the Bloomer equation: but because the necessity
to use it shows how little has yet been done;
shows that men still dwell on distinctions of sex, in
preference to identities of duty; that women are play-things
still in the popular estimate,&mdash;creatures of the
nursery and the drawing-room, but not angels of God,
joint-heirs of immortality.</p>

<p>We have not laid a secure foundation for any statement
on this subject, unless we have made it clear
that "woman's rights" are identical with "human
rights;" that what men do for women, they do in far
<em>wider</em> measure for themselves; that no father, brother,
or husband can have all the privileges ordained for
him of God, till mother and sister and wife are set
free to secure them according to instinctive individual
bias.</p>

<p>The subject would have no interest for me, if it
were but a selfish clamor of one class for advantages
over another; but it does interest me,&mdash;interest beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
all earthly debate,&mdash;because, in its evolution,
there unfolds also the highest interest of our common
humanity.</p>

<p>That public opinion has been somewhat conquered,
the reception given to women in the lyceum is alone
sufficient to show. When a woman of good social
standing struggles with convention on the one hand,
and womanly affection on the other, she still stands
<em>on the platform</em> somewhat as she <em>did at the stake</em>;
but, on the other hand, the awakening public interest
has nurtured a class of women who owe all that they
have and are to the platform itself.</p>

<p>With no oppressive restrictions in their circumstances,&mdash;endowed
with strong good sense and a
vigorous talent,&mdash;they have won their way to the
public esteem; and are stronger and healthier than
most women, only because they have had an object
for life and thought to grasp.</p>

<p>What will most help women in the matter of labor,
and, through labor, to their "civil rights," is a new
conception of the dignity of labor on the part of the
educated classes, men as well as women.</p>

<p>Harriet Hosmer comes back from Rome to queen
it over our men; Rosa Bonheur drives a tandem of
Flemish horses through a square of canvas, and over
the very necks of her critics: but we want women
who shall turn the trades into fine arts. Do you smile
at the expression? It is legitimate. France has already
answered my demand. A finer statue than the
"Moses" of Michael Angelo would be one womanly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
model of patient thoroughness. A finer picture than
the glowing pencils of Titian and Claude ever fused
into a canvas would be the prospective elevation of
manual labor.</p>

<p>The fine arts are already obedient to woman's will.
To <em>what</em> woman is it reserved to make the useful arts
pay tribute? Dependent upon the "right to labor,"
as we have already seen, is "woman's civil equality."
If all the fields of human labor are thrown absolutely
open (and you admit that they ought to be); if women
enter and grow wealthy therein; if every second
woman, for instance, were an intelligent property-holder,&mdash;is
it credible that she, or her husband for
her, would remain contented in her present minority?
Would she not want a seat in the legislature to protect
her property, a vote to control appropriations and
taxes? There are no revolutionists like the industrial
classes.</p>

<p>It was the discontent of merchants and artisans
which hunted Charles Stuart to the block, and paved
the way for English freedom. It was the discontent
of trade, a long-entertained moral disgust, culminating
in indignant contempt at a Stamp Act, which
secured American <em>independence</em>,&mdash;I wish we could
say, American <em>freedom</em> as well. Create, then, a class
of wealthy working women, you who are ambitious
of a female franchise, and society will be forced to
give you your desire.</p>

<p>Wendell Phillips says, that, when woman is once
brought to the ballot-box, men will cry out, "Educate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
her!" in self-preservation. If this be true (and I am
not sure that it is; for a great many popular elections
are at this moment carried in the Middle and Southern
States, to come no nearer home, by the <em>un</em>educated
class, partly by the dram-shops indeed),&mdash;if this <em>be</em>
true, however, it is a "poor rule which does not work
both ways;" and we may go farther than Mr. Phillips,
and say, he will also cry out, "Give her something
to do!" that she may understand the interests
of property, and be qualified to plead for them. Mr.
Phillips plants himself upon the right of suffrage, and
<em>goes back</em> to secure education and free labor, for State
reasons. He has every right to do it; but, on the
other hand, <em>we</em> may rest upon our undoubted right to
education, and go <em>forward</em>, with safe, strong steps,
to claim the right of suffrage. When a majority of
women find the means of thorough education open,
then a much greater number will seek actual employment,
and immediately the interests of property will
compel them to clamor for suffrage. Do not misunderstand
me. It is not a nation of paid underlings,
of ever so intelligent clerks and apprentices, men or
women, that will control the springs of government,
and overthrow institutions as well as prejudices, if
they stand in their way: it is the heads of firms, the
movers in great undertakings, the proprietors of mills,
the builders of ships, the contractors for supplies, persons
conversant with large interests, and quick to see
their jeopardy, which, as women no less than men,
must secure the elective right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>How I should rejoice to see a large Lowell mill
wholly owned and managed by women! What is to
make it possible?&mdash;only, that the unoccupied women
of wealth and rank, at this moment in the Commonwealth,
should combine to build or buy such a mill.
Suppose it <em>well</em> managed, representing ultimately a
million of dollars: do you believe it would long remain
without political power? Just as the testy trade
of Upsal demanded the franchise for its eighty-one
women, so would the Lowell mill.</p>

<p>Every year, these ten years, our sturdy friend Dr.
Hunt has sent up her protest to the city assessors.
She has not quite had the heart, as I wish some
woman had, to let them sell her household <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'gods'">goods</ins> over
her head, for non-payment of taxes; but the City
Government sits as serene and patient under her inflictions
as if she had never spoken. Her protests
probably go back to the pulp of the paper-mill; and,
but for the newspaper, we should never know that
they were written. But five thousand female property-holders,
calling their own caucus, and storming
the City Hall with well-concerted words, would compel
any government to listen; would compel committees
to sit, and departments to act. Let it be
your first duty, then, to add to the number of intelligent
female workers.</p>

<p>Last summer, I heard one of our friends say,
that the reason that men did not wish women to
enter medical societies, and receive medical diplomas,
was, that they were unwilling to be detected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
in their own double-dealing and malpractice. I
should not be willing to indorse a statement so
broadly made. Mean men may justify it: but the
men I have known, the men who have been at once
my inspiration and my strength,&mdash;these men were
not mean; yet among them even the bravest doubted,
at first, as to the expediency of our discussion.</p>

<p>These men have felt a tender reverence for moral
purity in woman. They have seen laborers of the
lower class fall as if smitten by a pestilence. They
had not faith to save the world at such a cost. From
the malpractice and guilty dread of mean men, then;
from the sensitive horror of the noblest, let us learn,
at least, that the duty woman owes the State is a
<em>moral</em> duty. A full understanding of this will give
her courage to press her claims. It is the power of
conscience and love which she is to bring to bear on
the ballot-box, and which is to mould, with her aid,
questions and interests hitherto untouched by any
higher impulse than the love of gain.</p>

<p>I cannot leave this statement of human rights,
without claiming for woman one right of which men
very commonly deprive her; in behalf of which society
makes no clamor, and about which the most radical
reformers say very little. I mean woman's right to
find man in his proper place, as counsellor and friend.</p>

<p>As <em>father</em>, to find him interested, equally with his
wife, in the spiritual custody and training of his
daughters; giving thus some portion of each day to
imbuing young womanly souls with manly strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>As <em>brother</em>, to find in him wise respect for womanhood,
and helpful free communion.</p>

<p>As <em>husband</em>, to find him, unless there is manifest
interposition of Providence, always at the head of
his family, always the support and counsellor of his
wife, as she in turn is to be his; making his love her
shelter, his strength her dependence, his experience
her guide, his manliness the complement of her
womanliness.</p>

<p>As a <em>son</em>, to find him always anxious and ready to
minister, provident to think, patient to bear, and willing
to act; never shirking, from idleness, the duty
which an active mother does not shrink from bending,
perhaps <em>breaking</em>, beneath.</p>

<p>Society sets man free from every conceivable family
duty, without a word. On the other hand, it
binds women down to them with cords of iron, and
is pitiless if a single one be snapped. I do not ask
society to require less of woman, but <em>more</em> of man.
There is an immense amount of cant, intentional and
unintentional, talked upon this subject. Last January,
I heard one of our wisest and best public teachers
speak upon the constitution of the family; and,
when he had spoken whole pages of solid sense, he
said this foolish thing,&mdash;that the life of the family
rested in the mother; that, when <em>she</em> died, the children
must scatter, the father could not hold them
alone, but that the father might be faithless or dissipated,
might abide in foreign countries, might
wander for years a stranger, and still the family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
sacredness be unbroken. I do not believe it. I protest
against such a view of the family, as a great
public evil, and one which no public teacher should
strengthen by any heedless or sentimental words.</p>

<p>No man has a right to ask any woman to be his
wife, who means to sacrifice her life to his own love
of business or pleasure or vagrancy; who does not
mean to stand strong at her side till death. I speak
for the heart of all womanhood when I say, that no
good woman would ever accept such an offer, if she
supposed she were to be idly left to fulfil its duties
alone. If God had intended to rear women independent
of manly influence, he would never have constituted
the family. It is because every woman needs
every man that its laws are absolute. If the physical
legitimacy of the family depend upon the mother, the
spiritual legitimacy depends upon the holy faithfulness
of the father. When death or sickness or imperative
duty takes her beloved ones from her, God sends to
woman the Comforter, who helps her to bear and do
her double duty. Yet even this angel is born of a
voiceless sorrow. It was in recognition of this human
need, as much as of the divine love, that Theodore
Parker was accustomed to pray to Him who is <em>both</em>
Father and Mother.</p>

<p>Do you object, that, under the present constitution
of society, man cannot find time for this fidelity?
When woman becomes an active worker, adding to
the resources of the household, man is set free from a
portion of his care. The future offers him ample<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
time; the present, more than he uses. I wish I could
see him as anxious to make acquaintance with his
own young children as with the gay society of his
neighborhood.</p>

<p>The actual guardianship of society is now thrown
into woman's hands. It does not belong to her: it
belongs to men <em>and</em> women.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Individual men shrink from the idea of being "governed
by their wives." From traditional indolence,
however, and that sentimental respect which does not
permit a man to sit in a woman's presence, the
"world" has certainly come to be governed by "<em>its</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
wife." Worst of all, nobody punishes it even by a
sneer.</p>

<p>The historical development of woman's social progress
corresponds to the logical statement upon which
I have insisted.</p>

<p>Nearly two centuries ago, Mary Astell would have
established a college for women; but the bigotry of
Bishop Burnet defeated her plans. The niece of a
beneficed clergyman, she had not the courage to press
her schemes against the open opposition of the church.
Many other efforts, like hers, to secure and make use
of education, led the way to a recognition of a
decided bias in the individual: so when, a century
later, Mary Wollstonecraft was born, the way was
open for the assertion of the right to labor. This
assertion is hardly indicated in her most celebrated
work; but it gives pungency and effect to the dreariest
pages of her novels.</p>

<p>In Australia, when a female child is born, the natives
break her finger-joints; an artificial distinction, which
<em>they</em> seem to think more decisive and enduring than
God's own limit of sex.</p>

<p>Mary Wollstonecraft saw, that civilized society,
enslaved by tradition and custom, imposed conditions
quite as arbitrary, and, to all practical purposes,
broke <em>every</em> joint in a woman's body; leaving
her helpless, to depend on the strength and skill and
affection of man.</p>

<p>A passionate and thriftless father, who spent more
than three daughters could earn, and whom she nevertheless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
protected to her dying day, did not give her a
very high idea of the security of such dependence.
The response to her appeal was heard in a myriad
of distinguished voices, and seen in the consecutive,
chosen, and persevering labors of Harriet Martineau
in political economy, of Anna Jameson in artistic
criticism, of Mary Carpenter in the reformation of
criminals, of Florence Nightingale in sanitary reform,
of Caroline Chisholm in emigration, of Mrs. Griffith
in marine botany (a special study, which she may
almost be said to have created), of Janet Taylor in
practical philanthropy among seamen, and nautical
astronomy.</p>

<p>This selection of duty shows the advance of the
movement. Formerly a woman might be literary in
a general sense: now she had the oversight of the
field, and might choose the place and kind of her
work.</p>

<p>All this prepared the way for the advent of Margaret
Fuller, and brought about the condition of which
she was the exponent. She caught the rumor which
floated in subtle discord all around her. Her quick
insight detected every true and living germ of thought
in the confused social deposits and exhalations. Out
of the discord, she wrought a quaint and scholarly
music; out of the refuse, she enriched a fragrant garden:
and this song, this outgrowth, had an essential
music and beauty, and were caught at once to the
popular heart.</p>

<p>That the division of labor was already taking place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
was obvious enough to her: so she claimed, in advance,
the right of suffrage. Society was already
prepared to make this claim, but only discovered its
readiness as it listened to her enthusiastic song. Like
Deborah, our friend struck her cymbals; and, when
the heart of the people shouted consent, they "made
her a judge over them."</p>

<p>Although it was doubtless owing to many older
causes, it seemed as if her statement of the "great
lawsuit" in 1844 led to the first Woman's Convention
at Seneca Falls in 1848; and, in 1850, the National
Woman's-rights Association began the yearly work
in which it has ever since persevered.</p>

<p>Man, as well as woman, has been forced to respect
this work, moved by the moral destitution in the lowest,
and the profane inanity in the highest, ranks of
life, which is the result of our social depravity.</p>

<p><em>Profane inanity</em>, I repeat; for every helpless woman
is a living, intolerable blasphemy against the Most
High. Not more a blasphemy than every helpless
man; but society neither expects, defends, nor provides
for, helpless <em>men</em>. It is only the helpless woman
who is expected and approved.</p>

<p>Often do we hear it said, that no law forbids American
women to <em>work</em>.</p>

<p>Neither, it has been responded, is there any <em>law</em>
which forbids Chinese women to <em>walk</em>; but the careful
ligatures, so closely pressed by unsuspecting mothers
about those tender feet, do not do their work more
surely than the inevitable restrictions of society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>In summing up this constantly accruing list of
influences and changes, I must again direct your
attention to the fact, that, from the earliest dawn of
modern civilization, women have been, in some nations
at least, invested with political power.</p>

<p>The mock-marriage, by which the woman's entailed
suffrage served a fraudulent purpose; the abbesses
called to Parliament in right of abbey-lands, the permission
accorded to the eighty-one women of Upsal,
the position of the French "Dames de la Halle," the
female stockholders in the East-India Company, that
one persistent female property-holder in Nova Scotia,
the fifty-dollar proclamation-money in New Jersey,&mdash;all
indicate that there never <em>has</em> been, and never <em>will</em>
be, any serious difficulty about woman's voting in
any age or any country where the right to vote depends
upon the possession of property, and where
she herself professes to desire it.</p>

<p>Understand, then, that the abstract right to vote is
not the question for you to consider: that was settled
some hundreds of years ago.</p>

<p>The practical question for American men to put to
themselves is, whether their own democratic experiment
is a failure. Will you go back to the property
basis for your own franchise? or do you still profess
to believe, that man&mdash;as man, as child of God&mdash;has
a right to reign, which does not depend upon broad
doubloons or broad acres? And, if man has this
right upon a simple human ground, how can you
deny it to woman?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>Will you say that she is not human,&mdash;that she has
no soul?</p>

<p>Even Mahomet did better than that. Some one
once asked him if the marriage-tie were immortal,
and if a husband might claim his wife in the next
world:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"If the man be the superior being," he replied, "he can
claim his wife or not, as he chooses; but, if the woman be
the superior, the decision must rest with her."</p></blockquote>

<p>And what Mahomet thus prophesied of the world
to come is clearly true of the world that is. There is
no such thing as cheating either God or humanity.</p>

<p>Let him who aspires to rule <em>make himself superior</em>
in understanding and moral purpose, and he <em>will</em>
rule.</p>

<p>No possibilities, visible or invisible, need daunt
him; but, let him be false by one hair's breadth, and
he carries his doom in his own bosom as certainly as
the flawed crystal at the approach of frost.</p>

<p>You are, then, to base your demand for woman's
civil rights upon her simple humanity,&mdash;the value of
the soul itself.</p>

<p>If you deny this foundation for her, you deny it for
yourselves, and the Declaration of Independence is
only an impertinent pretence.</p>

<p>It may not be easy to push this truth home, and
force your friends and neighbors to consider it; but,
once convinced in your own minds, you cannot escape
from the responsibility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>Wendell Phillips once told us of an old catechism,
printed, I think, at Venice in 1563, which contained
the following question and answer:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Q.</em> How shall I show my obedience to God?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> By never doing any thing which is disagreeable to
my neighbor.</p></blockquote>

<p>Is it possible that this catechism is still in general
use?</p>

<p>Fashionable morality is of so loose a sort, that to
do any thing disagreeable to one's neighbor is still, in
the estimation of most people, the unpardonable sin.
People who are capable of hesitating on that account
need not be greatly anxious about their responsibility.</p>

<p>Our cause does not need them; resting, not on
timid self-deceivers, but on immutable truth, and the
hallowed recognition of woman herself.</p>

<p>Society still cries, like King John in the play,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The only respect in which all men continue for ever to be equal, is that
of the equal right which every man has to defend himself; but this involves
a source of much inequality in respect to the things which any one may
have a right to defend."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Adam Ferguson.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"></a></span></p>




<h2>TEN YEARS:</h2>

<h5>AN APPENDIX.</h5>

<hr class="r5" />

<blockquote><p>"To go on working, I consider the only thing to do; and, when friends urge
this after every fresh effort, their doing so in itself contains a kind of
verdict."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy.</span></p></blockquote>


<p class="dropcap">THERE are some items of interest, that have come
under my observation, for the first time, during
the last few years, which I have not found it possible
to add to the preceding lectures without destroying
their symmetry. I therefore offer them in
an Appendix. They are not placed here because they
are unimportant, but simply that the later progress of
public opinion may be set forth by itself.</p>

<p>For the last five years, the women of the United
States have held few public discussions. They have
done wisely. Circumstances have proved their friend.
Nothing ever had done, nothing ever will do again, so
great a service to woman, in so short a time, as this
dreadful war, out of which we are so slowly emerging.
Respect for woman came only with the absolute need
of her; and so many women of distinguished ability
made themselves of service to the government, that
we had no single woman to honor as England had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
honored Florence Nightingale. With us, her name
was <em>legion</em>. But with the prospect of peace comes
the old duty of agitation; and we find ourselves again
summoned to our work, and again anxiously awaiting
its results,&mdash;<em>anxiously</em>, for the public work of women
is an object which still attracts the gaze of the curious;
and the smallest indiscretion on the part of a
single woman has a retrograde effect, which very few
seem able to measure.</p>

<p>Our reform is unlike all others; for it must begin in
the family, at the very heart of society. If it be not
kindly, temperately, and thoughtfully conducted, men
everywhere will be able to justify their remonstrances.
Let us rather justify <em>ourselves</em>. My last report to any
convention was made to those called in Boston in
1859 and 1860. Between that time and 1863, I
printed five volumes, which are nothing but reports
upon the various interests significant to our cause.
During the last four years, I have watched the development
of American industry in its relation to women,
and have, through the newspapers, aroused public
feeling in their behalf. My labor is naturally classed
under the three heads of Education, Labor, and Law.
A proper education must prepare woman for labor,
skilled or manual: and the experience of a laborer
should introduce her to citizenship; for it provides
her with rights to protect, privileges to secure, and
property to be taxed. If she be a laborer, she must
have an interest in the laws which control labor.</p>

<p>In considering our position in these three respects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
it is impossible to offer a digest of all that has occurred
during the last six years. What I have to say will
refer chiefly to the events of the last two.</p>


<h5>EDUCATION.</h5>

<p>The most important educational movement of the
last two years has been the formation of an American
Association for the Promotion of Social Science, with
four departments, and two women on its Board of
Directors. Subsequently, the Boston Association was
organized, with seven departments, and seven women
on its Board of Directors; one woman being assigned
to each department, including that of law.
Any woman in the United States can become a
member of the American association. If the opportunities
it offers are not seized, it will be the fault
of women themselves.</p>

<p>During the past winter, the Lowell Institute in Boston,
in connection with the government of the Massachusetts
Technological Institute, took a step which
deserves public mention. They advertised classes for
both sexes, under the most eligible professors, for instruction
in French, mathematics, and natural science.
As the training was to be thorough, the number of
pupils was limited, and the <em>women</em> who applied would
have filled the seats many times over. These classes
have been wholly free, and have added to the obligation
which the free Art School for women had already
conferred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 25th of June, 1865, the Ripley College, at
Poultney, Vt., celebrated its Commencement. Seventeen
young ladies were graduated. Ralph Waldo
Emerson delivered the literary address, and two days
were devoted to the examination of incoming pupils.
Feeling very little satisfaction in the success of colleges
intended for the separate sexes, I take more
pleasure in speaking of the Baker University, in
Kansas, which was chartered by the Legislature of
that State in 1857, as a university for both sexes.
It has now been in active operation for seven years.
A little more than a year ago, Miss Martha Baldwin,
a graduate of the Baldwin University at Berea, Ohio,
was appointed to the chair of Greek and Latin. She
is but twenty-one years of age, but was elected by
the government to make the address for the faculty
at the opening of the Commencement exercises, and
seems to have given entire satisfaction during the
year.</p>

<p>Howard University was chartered at the last session
of Congress, for the education of all classes of students,
without distinction of sex, race, or color. It
has purchased three acres of land in a pleasant part
of Washington, and is now ready to receive about
twenty-five students. Rev. Dr. Boynton, chaplain of
the House of Representatives, is President of the
Board of Trustees.</p>

<p>St. Lawrence University, Canton, N.Y., a university
still very young, graduates both men and women,
on precisely the same conditions. Civil engineering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
and political economy are the only optional studies
with the women. It reports one theological student.
Lombard University, Galesburg, Ill., does the same;
but I know nothing of its standard of scholarship.
It is only within the last year that I have been able
to visit the most conspicuous colleges in this country
in which women are taught with men. I consider the
system of mixed classes an immense advantage, as it
secures the standard of scholarship, prevents all foolish
hazing, and places personal character and moral
deportment in their right relations to classic study.
It prevents also such instruction in the classics as
must necessarily deprave the estimate of woman.</p>


<h5>OBERLIN.</h5>

<p>About all that I knew of Antioch, before I went
West, was this,&mdash;that it was a college for the instruction
of both sexes. I would like to have my
readers know more of Antioch than I did, and to feel,
without seeing it, the same intense interest that
warms me now. They have heard of Oberlin, I suppose,&mdash;heard
of it as a sort of fanatical way-station
between the district school and Harvard University,
where men, women, and "colored people" are all
taught together. If I should show them what Oberlin
has actually <em>done</em>, I think they may see more
plainly what it is possible for Antioch to do: so I
shall begin with some account of this college, which
has "saved the North-west."</p>

<p>It is no idle boast: and, when I had stayed a week<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
at Antioch, and was thoroughly roused to a sense of
its immense importance; when I had seen how admirably
fitted was Dr. Hosmer for the work given him
to do,&mdash;I decided this in my own mind; namely, that
if any one thing had stood in the way of Antioch
hitherto, if any thing had prevented her complete
work, it was the Eastern prejudice, the idea that men
and women could not be educated together. And, as
they had been trying this experiment at Oberlin for
thirty-two years, I thought I would go there, and see
how it had worked. If I had known then, what I
know now, that out of the bosom of Oberlin twenty-two
colleges had sprung, and that, of the twenty-two,
ten are at this moment officered by her own graduates,
I think I might have spared myself the trouble.
Here are their names; for you will care more for
Oberlin, if you get some glimpse of the work she has
done, before I tell you the details of her story. I
have put an asterisk against the names of the colleges
whose presidents are graduates of Oberlin. All
of those named receive pupils of both sexes.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Ohio.</em>&mdash;Baldwin University, Berea, three colleges and
one university, 326 pupils, 1846; Heidelberg College, Tiffin;
Antioch College, Yellow Springs; Mount Union College, Alliance;
Otterbein College, Westerville, a Gallery of Fine Arts
forming, 360 students.</p>

<p><em>Michigan.</em>&mdash;*Olivet College, 308 pupils; *Hillsdale College,
609 pupils; *Albion College; *Adrian College, with an
endowment of $300,000.</p>

<p><em>Wisconsin.</em>&mdash;Madison University; *Ripon College, 87
pupils.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><em>Illinois.</em>&mdash;Wheaton College, 219 pupils; Lombard University.</p>

<p><em>Indiana.</em>&mdash;*Union Christian College, Mecom, 115 graduates.</p>

<p><em>Minnesota.</em>&mdash;*Northfield College.</p>

<p><em>New York.</em>&mdash;Genesee College, Lima; Elmira College.</p>

<p><em>Kentucky.</em>&mdash;Berea College.</p>

<p><em>Kansas.</em>&mdash;State University, Lawrence; Lincoln College,
Topeka; Baker University.</p>

<p><em>Iowa.</em>&mdash;Grenell College; *Tabor College, 192 pupils.</p></blockquote>

<p>To these we may add Oberlin herself, with 1,145
pupils for the term which has just closed, and the
prospect of a college in Missouri, which her president
has recently been solicited to organize. Wherever I
have obtained the catalogues of 1866, I have recorded
the present number of students in these colleges. To
those I have not marked, it will be fair to allow an
average of 210 students. Those are not high schools,
be it understood, but colleges in the proper sense.
There is no doubt, that Oberlin, as the principal educational
influence in Ohio, imposed upon Antioch
and all other "Christian" colleges the necessity of
educating both sexes.</p>

<p>In 1832, Oberlin was a little religious colony, born
into a complete wilderness out of the Presbyterian
Church. The plan of the colony involved a school,
for which a tract of five hundred acres was given.
The sale of the remainder of a tract of six thousand
acres furnished a small fund with which to begin
teaching. A year later, the students of Lane Seminary
determined to hold an antislavery prayer meeting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
The trustees forbade it. "You are right," said
old Dr. Beecher, when the mutinous lads appealed to
him,&mdash;"you are right; but we are too weak to hold
Lane Seminary on antislavery principles. Go and
make it possible for us." They went&mdash;Theodore
Weld and Henry B. Stanton among them&mdash;to speak
the truth at Oberlin. Arthur Tappan called from the
Broadway Tabernacle the man who had been in the
front of the great awakening which has swept
through the land, instinct in every fibre of his being
with the spirit of aggressive Christian work. "Go,"
he wrote to President Finney,&mdash;"go and teach the
young men whom Lane refuses." One hundred thousand
dollars was pledged by the merchants. Oberlin
studied in summer that her pupils might teach all
winter. So, promising to return to New York for the
winter seasons, President Finney found his way, one
muddy spring morning, to Oberlin. What he found
there was two frame-houses in the midst of the forest,
and half a dozen log-cabins. He found also his sixty
students.</p>

<p>Very soon they had no end of difficulties to contend
with. A jealous college, that had wanted Dr. Finney
for its president, did its best to break down Oberlin.
The crash of 1837 came; and Arthur Tappan, and
the rest who had not paid out capital, ceased to pay
interest. It was necessary to raise $50,000, and President
Finney went to England and did it. Every
man's hand was against them. The cross-roads were
ornamented with pictures of fugitive slaves, pursued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
by lions and tigers, and running in the direction of
Oberlin. But when Oberlin became a station on the
underground railroad, and the slave-hunters actually
came there after their chattels, the case altered. The
neighborhood took part with the college, as if by
miraculous conversion, and the offensive pictures disappeared.
Then a thousand scholarships were instituted,
at $100 each. Some were perpetual; some for
six, eight, or ten years. On the interest of this investment
the college now lives. The scholarships, as
they fall in, increase its means. It costs $15,000 per
annum, and $15 is the student's yearly fee. He rents
his scholarship of a broker in the town. The college
is managed with exquisite economy, and the most
perfect attention to essential neatness.</p>

<p>For twenty years the college sent out into the West
five hundred antislavery pupils yearly, to take the
post of teachers, ministers, editors, and lawyers.
They were heretics, so they were pushed farther and
farther West. For the last fifteen years, it has sent
out a thousand yearly. In all, twenty-five thousand
men and women have gone out from her bosom, who
have eaten and drank and recited at the same board
with the colored man. Through all her pecuniary
troubles, her original teachers have stayed by her, have
given up all else for her sake; and President Finney
has never been without a colored student at his table.
There are two large churches in the town; for a
population of four thousand persons has grown up
to supply the wants of the college, which has the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
great advantage of still retaining the services of those
who originally created it. Last year, Dr. Finney, now
nearly eighty years old, resigned his position as president,
but still remains at the head of the Theological
School. I had always thought Oberlin bigoted to
evangelical ways. I did not find it so. I was made
as welcome to cross-question classes as if I had been
an ordained graduate of their own. All theological
teaching is done by discussion; and the fact that the
colleges which have grown up under her graduates
are of all persuasions, from the Methodist to the Christian,
will show that doctrine is not urged. In all the
recitation-rooms, questions were freely asked by both
sexes; and this questioning is encouraged by all the
professors but one, a young man from Yale. "Yes,"
said President Fairchild, himself a graduate of Oberlin,
when I had pointed this out; "yes, that is what
remains of New-England stiffness. Six months will
convert him: we shall let him take his own time." I
have never seen any thing like the enthusiasm this
college inspires in those who labor for it. Would that
I could see a man bred at Harvard with the same
patient fire in his soul as President Finney! As I
knelt by his side morning and evening, I felt that
under his ministry the very <em>stones</em> must cry out. The
twenty-five thousand men sent out from Oberlin did
not go out as citizens merely, but as <em>teachers</em>. I was
not surprised to find, that, a few months before the
Proclamation of Emancipation, a letter had gone to
Washington, from President Finney, entreating Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
Lincoln to "recognize the hand of the Lord in this
matter." In Oberlin, it is believed to have substantially
modified the proclamation. Oberlin sent eight hundred
and fifty men into the field during the rebellion.
Professor Peck, our minister to Hayti, is the man who
was once imprisoned by slave-hunters in Cleveland
jail. An indignant mass-meeting was held in that
city. Six hundred sabbath-school children went from
Oberlin to greet their imprisoned superintendent, and
the prosecuting attorney thought it best to give up the
case. Professor Monroe, married to a daughter of
President Finney, is our consul at Rio, and is well
known as a controlling political power in Ohio.
One of the faculty headed the first Oberlin regiment;
a graduate of the Theological School, the second;
Colonel Cooper, of the third, who went through with
Sherman, is still doing antislavery work in Arkansas;
and the present Governor of Ohio, Major-General
Cox, also married to a daughter of Mr. Finney, has
a record so brilliant, that it demands a volume in
itself.</p>

<p>During the war, the college realized one unexpected
advantage from the presence of women. The female
pupils kept the college working! In the original constitution
of Oberlin, it was stated that its main object
was "to diffuse pure religion throughout the Mississippi
Valley, and to elevate the female character."
To both these objects it has been religiously faithful.
In the Ladies' Library Room I saw a picture of Camp
Dennison. It was drawn by one of the graduates;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
was sent from camp to college, with the inscription
beneath, "From the boys at Camp Dennison to the
girls of '61,&mdash;the dearest girls in all the world." It
was not put out of sight, but proudly shown to me.
I have never been in any educational institution where
the interests of the <em>pupils</em> so evidently rule. The vacation
comes in winter, that the pupils may pass it in
teaching; but the professors do not then take a vacation.
They open a winter school, where students
who are behindhand may make up deficiencies. I
do not mean that all the pupils go through the entire
college course: many cannot afford it. They stay as
long as they can, and go reluctantly away.</p>

<p>They follow the fashions at Oberlin: the Continental
pronunciation took possession of the Greek
and Latin class-rooms last year. They employ undergraduates
to teach the preparatory students at
thirty cents an hour. The common or town school
has 830 pupils, 180 of whom are colored. In the college,
the colored pupils are 5 to 100, and the female
pupils 40 out of 50. There are scarcely any rules.
The few that are printed are enforced as friendly advice.
President Finney says he has often known a
year to pass without an opportunity for a presidential
admonition. The management of the girls seems to
me admirable. The teachers <em>feel</em> no doubt of their
method; therefore they show none. Once a fortnight
the lady principal meets the ladies, and talks with
them privately on all questions of womanly habits
and manners. The splendid endowment of Vassar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
College could not give to Oberlin a woman better
suited to this purpose than Mrs. Dascomb. Once a
week there is a religious meeting.</p>

<p>The college has just now the brightest prospects.
Its old buildings were far less convenient than those
at Antioch; but at a late Commencement an appeal
was made, and by a spasmodic response, like that
which recently gave us $30,000 for Meadville, the
graduates subscribed as much for a new "Ladies'
Hall." The contracts were made before the war, the
expenses managed with scrupulous prudence; and
now a beautiful brick building, 121 feet by 121, is
opened. It has a library, reading-room, and parlors;
and a dining-hall, to which the male students are
admitted, and where truly excellent board is given
for three dollars a week. The kitchen would do
anybody's heart good. On every floor is a wood
and water room, where the wood and ashes go up and
down on a dumb-waiter, where water is carried up in
a well-protected pipe, and slops may be thrown into
a sink. Two excellent new buildings for recitations
will be ready for the spring term. Some idea of the
admirable tact and prudence which have prevailed at
Oberlin may be gleaned from the following anecdote:
Thirty-three years passed before a colored <em>teacher</em> was
employed in the Preparatory School. "We knew,"
said President Fairchild, "that we must not try the
experiment till it was sure to be a magnificent success."
In 1865, Oberlin had in Miss Fanny Jackson
a pupil worthy of the experiment. She had been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
slave in the District of Columbia, and so puny, that,
at an early age, she was sold to her own aunt, a freedwoman,
for a trivial sum. She was sent here, and
with fear and trembling now yielded to the wish of
the president. That no one might be compelled to
enter her class, <em>two</em> advanced classes in English grammar
were organized, one under the present wife of
Dr. Finney. On the first day, an over-grown lad
came to the president, and said, "My father would
not like it very well if he knew I was taught by a
woman,&mdash;but a woman and a negro!" "Stay in
the class three days to please me," said the president;
and, at the end of that time, the boy refused to be
removed. After a day's absence from illness, Miss
Jackson was received with cheers; and, when her class
had to be subdivided, the heart-burnings of those
who had to leave it were pitiable. She is now teaching
in the Colored High School in Philadelphia, where
she will remain till she has paid the price of her freedom.
The brilliancy of her classical teaching is considered
very remarkable in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>It remains only to consider the double system.
Everybody at Oberlin was loud in its praise; no one
would teach now in any other sort of college. The
presence of women secured discipline. There was no
chance for hazing or any other antiquated folly. Pupils
and teachers who had gone from Oberlin to Vassar
both missed the pleasant excitement of the old life.</p>

<p>"But," said President Finney, when I turned from
all the rest to him, "it must not be forgotten that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
have had great advantages. We came here for a
religious reason; our pupils <em>came</em> for years. It is only
lately that they have been <em>sent</em>. I expect that some
difficulties may arise, but none worse than would
arise in a neighborhood-school. It is God's way to
rear us." The old man showed me, with great emotion,
a confession, signed by three young girls, and
read at college prayers in 1837. They had been walking,
and met one of the students with an improvised
sledge; without thinking, they jumped on and took a
drive. There were no rules against it; but, when they
came home, they remembered how much depended on
their prudence as members of an antislavery institution,
and wrote the confession of their own accord.
One of these lovely women is now the wife of President
Fairchild.</p>

<p>I record with pride the history of Oberlin, the first
college which undertook to teach resident pupils of
both sexes. I feel that it has been a great success.
I am ashamed of the half-denominational prejudice
which kept me from taking a warmer interest in it,
in advance; and I greet its new life under President
Fairchild, a graduate of the institution, with the warmest
feelings of hope and admiration.</p>

<p>It has just received $25,000 from the executors of
the estate of the Rev. Charles Avery, of Pittsburg,
who left $150,000 in trust, to be devoted, according
to the best judgment of the directors, to the "education
and elevation of the colored people in the United
States and Canadas." The conditions are, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
college shall never make any discrimination, on account
of color, against colored students, and that it
shall furnish free tuition to fifty of its most needy
colored students who may apply for it; preference
being given to twenty to be nominated by the American
Missionary Association.</p>


<h5>ANTIOCH.</h5>

<p>The road to Antioch is hard to find: indeed, it
would seem as if the trustees had specially secluded
it,&mdash;made interest, perhaps, with the railroads to
prevent the cars from stopping there, for the special
protection of the young people! From Cincinnati,
we wind along the lovely banks of the little Miami,
through nurseries and hillside terraces, through groves
of oak and sycamore, and birch-trees stretching out
white, bewildered arms. Pigs are quietly grazing in
the woods, as if it were their nature to "chew the
cud;" there are groups of tiny powder-houses, made
small, the people say, because they are "expected to
blow up once a fortnight"! Heavy loads of corn and
hay wind along the terraced roads; a gay-looking
negro on horseback takes off his hat; two children are
pulling a boat across the Miami; there are no houses
along the shore, only safe-looking spits of sand jut
out here and there; and, at last, having come the ten
miles from Xenia in a private carriage, we roll on to
Antioch Plain. I had heard that the college was
on high land; so I was a little disappointed to find it
on a table among the hills, which did not command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
any marvellous extent of country. As for the college,
it has evidently made its toilet for posterity. I
could not get a glimpse of its two fine towers and
broad front, till I wandered down to the railroad
track, and looked at it from the vicinity of a lime-kiln
and a sorghum-mill. For some unknown reason,
it turned its back on the village in the beginning, and
pranks its beauty in full sight of that cursive population
which travels by steam.</p>

<p>Yellow Springs is a pretty little place to live in,&mdash;an
economical one, certainly, for there isn't a thing
in it to buy; and, when we have looked at two or
three little churches and Judge Mills's pretty park,
we are quite content to go through the grounds of the
Yellow Springs House, look down on the glen from
the quaint, long, low southern piazza of the Neff
House, and finally get home as we may, by log-bridges,
and banks of moss, over which the walking-fern is
striding. Ten miles of hedge, made of the Osage
orange, surround the Neff Place, which a wealthy
family in Cincinnati refuse to sell; but which is destined,
in the far future, for a large hotel. In the little
glen,&mdash;where a beautiful cascade falls, and tortuous
rapids sputter and foam, and tiny fish dart up and
down, and great graceful trees bend to shelter us,&mdash;we
may find all the beauty of the White-Mountain
passes. Two or three miles off, there are persimmons
in the woods, and fossils under the soil; and, on Saturdays,
pleasant parties go with Mr. Orton or Professor
Clarke to find them. The "Yellow Spring,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
which gives the town its name, is of course largely
impregnated with iron. It is imprisoned in a stone
tank, which it colors brown; and it changes a rusty
iron ladle to gold. It is a tonic; and, not far from the
spot where it bubbles up, there is a pretty summer-house,
where those who come to drink may sit and
rest. As we walked toward it, a little brown rabbit
skipped across the grass. From every high point in
the glen, there are lovely views of the college and
town.</p>

<p>Dr. Hosmer has just introduced a change into the
Sunday-morning service at the chapel. He has taken
the service-book of James Freeman Clarke, and, between
reading and chanting, devised a matin service
of great beauty. No musical professors could have
done greater credit to the first performance than the
students themselves. It made the bare, whitewashed
walls of the chapel seem as sacred as a grand cathedral.</p>

<p>I did not look into the books at Antioch. Those
at Oberlin I thoroughly investigated; and the strict
economy the figures showed would distinguish honorably
any institution in any land. But, as far as I
can judge from oral testimony, the fees of the students
and the interest of the endowment fund here
amount to $13,000, and do not <em>quite</em> provide for the
annual expenses. There is, therefore, no fund for
<em>repairs</em>, none for <em>scientific instruments</em>, none for the
<em>library</em>; and, while the president and professors feel
that a further endowment will sometime be needed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>&mdash;nay,
is needed <em>now</em>,&mdash;yet they also feel that they
must show what work Antioch can do, before they ask
further sympathy. Still, there are some few things
which the wise prudence of the trustees, the thoughtfulness
of loving friends, the surplus of full purses, can,
in a quiet way, provide.</p>

<p>The pupils at Antioch make no complaint of their
commons this year; yet it is undeniable that they
should be better than they are. The commons are
provided at Oberlin and Antioch in the same way;
that is, by a family entirely disconnected with the college.
At Oberlin, the table presents an attractive
appearance. It would be grateful to any hungry person,
and board is furnished at $3 a week. At Antioch,
a pleasant and friendly woman has charge of
things; but no great variety seems to be offered, and
the board is $3.50 per week. Both these prices seem
to me, after investigating Western markets, <em>starvation
prices</em>; but it is evident, that, on this point, we have
something to learn from Oberlin. If the president
and faculty of Antioch should visit Oberlin, where they
would be most kindly received, they would see, perhaps,
that the difficulty lies in the cooking-apparatus.
Oberlin offers a first-rate kitchen; Antioch, one very
far behind what most of the pupils would find at
home. I suppose no one will deny, that, when the
average social standing of the students in these Western
colleges is considered, it is desirable that they
should find at the college-table a standard of cooking
and serving which is a little in advance of that to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
which they have been used. The food may be plain
and without variety, but it should be thoroughly nice
and inviting of its kind. The ladies of any one of our
city churches might undertake to furnish the kitchen
at Antioch, and they could not have a better model
than the kitchen at Oberlin. To advance the standard
over previous experience, is, I think, a necessary
part of education here.</p>

<p>Still farther, cisterns should be built in the upper
stories of the dormitories, into which the waste-water
may run from the roofs. Pipes leading downward
from this should supply one sink on each story, and
this sink should also carry away the waste-water from
the rooms. A large "dumb waiter"&mdash;I use the
word for want of a better&mdash;should be provided in
each dormitory to carry up wood, and carry down
ashes and dry dirt. I have already shown that this
is done at Oberlin; and, if cisterns are not possible,
then reservoirs and a forcing-pump should take their
place.</p>

<p>There are but two dormitories,&mdash;one for men, and
one for women; and when we consider, that, beside
studying, the pupils have to help themselves by sawing
wood and other manual labor, it will be acknowledged,
that to bring their own wood and water up
two or three flights of stairs is more than we can ask
of them.</p>

<p>The library and scientific apparatus are very deficient
for present needs. In the scientific department,
some means of protecting the apparatus already obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
is greatly wanted. Microscopes are needed for
scientific investigation. In the library, a translation
of the "Mécanique Céleste," modern scientific books
generally, Smith's "Bible Dictionary," and the leading
works on English literature, are required. Trench,
Müller, Taine, have not yet found their way to Yellow
Springs.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>It seems to me, that, before Antioch, there now opens
a great career. If her trustees and her faculty will
but keep faith in her methods, surely we are bound to
help them to the utmost. The personal friends of Dr.
Hosmer also, who realize the nobility of that enthusiasm
which made him willing to accept such a post
while "looking towards sunset," ought, I think, to make
the position as easy as possible, by anticipating these
practical wants. Five hundred dollars would supply
the most necessary books to the library.</p>

<p>But, if Oberlin does such noble work, what need of
Antioch? Why should we strive to sustain an institution
at such a continual cost, if one already established
is competent to do its work? Let us get a
glimpse of what Antioch can do, and then we shall
be better able to answer these questions. In the first
place, we are in possession of buildings worth now
$180,000, and of twenty acres of land, worth $10,000.
The land was a donation, in the beginning, from
Judge Mills, the great man of the village, who perhaps
fancied that a growing college would increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
the value of his real estate; and for this property,
worth now nearly $200,000, we gave $50,000. For
its proper appropriation we are responsible; and I
think we have work enough to do, though Oberlin
has saved the North-west, and though her new halls
should be crowded thrice over.</p>

<p>In the first place, Antioch is to be a missionary
station. No one who has not travelled through the
West can imagine the thirst of the people for spiritual
food. I think those who know least about it are
the Western ministers themselves. I always found
them sceptical about it, when I spoke to them; and
I could not very well say, what I was sometimes compelled
to feel, "It is because you could never satisfy
this want, that it does not show itself to you." To
Dr. Hosmer, however, with his warm, genial soul,
with a temper conciliatory and discreet, the people are
willing to speak. Beside the daily college prayers,
there are services in the chapel on Sunday at half-past
eight in the morning, and at three in the afternoon.
During the last year, the audiences at the Sunday
preaching had dwindled to a score: since Dr. Hosmer's
arrival, it averages about two hundred and fifty;
and, of course, townspeople, who come to the chapel
regularly, grow in sympathy with the college and its
purposes. Dr. Hosmer has promised to supply the
Christian pulpit in Yellow Springs for eight Sundays,
which gives Mr. McConnell liberty to do missionary
work for the same time. The little town of Troy has
some difficulty in keeping a minister. Dr. Hosmer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
promises him four Sundays, that he may go away,
and so add to his substance. He goes also himself
to the Universalist church in Columbus; and at
Cleveland, where about twenty Unitarian families
are hoping sometime to have a church, he promises
them an occasional service if they will pay the expenses
of transit. Professor Hosmer, whose preaching
is thoroughly appreciated in the neighborhood,
has also preached in Marietta; and either he or his
father stands ready to supply Mr. Mayo's pulpit
when that gentleman undertakes the missionary
work, which has already made him one of the most
useful of the Western clergy.</p>

<p>Who are the people that have this college in
charge? What sort of pupils are likely to benefit by
the education we offer? If we know a little about
them, perhaps it will kindle a warmer interest. Beside
the two Hosmers whom we know, there is Dr.
Craig, Professor Weston and his wife, Professor
Clarke, and Mr. Orton, with four teachers under him
in the preparatory department. Dr. Craig was the
man whom Horace Mann thought it constituted an
era in his life to know. For fifteen years he was the
minister of the church at Blooming Grove, Orange
County, N.Y., a church which has existed for more
than a hundred years without a creed, and which is
governed by seven deacons and seven deaconesses.
Professor Weston and his wife divide the classical
department between them, having both taken the
degree of A.M. at Oberlin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>Professor Clarke is the son of the famous Methodist
minister in Chicago. He was professor of mathematics
in Michigan University, and went abroad
for two years to fit himself more thoroughly for his
work. The war called him home; he raised a company,
was made major, and, being taken prisoner,
was thrown into Libby. There, he says, one of our
Boston boys saved his life by sharing his supplies
with him. He was removed to Macon, and, while
sharing all the horrible experience of the stockade,
succeeded in digging a tunnel, through which he
would have escaped; but some other prisoners doing
the same thing, and the escape of one being sure to
lead to the detection of all, he waited honorably for
the second tunnel to be completed. Meanwhile he
was removed to Charleston, and put under Gilmore's
fire, where, at last, his exchange was effected. When
Professor Clarke left Michigan University to come to
Antioch, he made a sacrifice born of the true missionary
spirit. May we share his spirit sufficiently
to strengthen his hands in the new work! Mr. Orton
is most admirably fitted to his department, and has
an excellent corps of teachers under him. Among
them is one, the daughter of a mechanic, that went
from Worcester to assist in building the college, who
got her own education at Antioch by alternate years
of study and teaching, having to earn one year what
she spent the next. A more exquisite model school
than that connected with the college, I never saw.</p>

<p>Among the older pupils of Antioch is the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
minister of Yellow Springs, the Mr. McConnell of
whom I spoke, who may be called, if you prefer it, a
brigadier-general. He was born humbly, in Ohio,
had only the rudest schooling, was a Christian minister
before he was twenty, and married before he was
twenty-one. He was preaching in Troy when the
first gun was fired at Sumter. He raised a company
at once, and got a lieutenant's commission. In actual
service, he was soon made a captain. He kept with
General Grant throughout his Western campaign,
and returned from Pittsburg Landing the colonel of
his regiment; then re-enlisted for the war, went
back to the front, kept with the Western army, and,
at the close of the war, was mustered out a brigadier-general.
He did signal service in many battles, but
especially before Nashville, where his brigade, assisted
by a negro brigade, broke Hood's centre by a very
gallant charge. He went to Atlanta with Sherman,
and could never weary of telling me how the Sanitary
and Educational Commission followed the army with
their fostering care, ever present, it seemed to him,
like the blood which supplies with food the minutest
nervous fibre of the human frame. When he returned,
the people would have carried him into Congress; but
he declined. Then they offered to make him a judge
of probate, with a salary of $2,500 a year; but he told
them he had chosen the pulpit for his field: and now,
preaching in Yellow Springs, he comes into the college
classes, and, hoping to take his degree, keeps
faithfully all the college rules.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<p>Still another pupil, now thirty years old, raised a
company for the war. He was at the fall of Vicksburg,
had not been at school since he was ten years
old, but made $1,800 by buying and selling grain, and
brought it here to carry him through college. When
I cross-examined him in Greek history, I found he
had read Grote! The teacher of the village school at
Yellow Springs has had a more vexatious experience.
He had finished his third year at Antioch, when he
went into the army. He became an aid to three
Western generals successively, and was with Grant
when Lee surrendered. He saved $800 of his pay to
carry him through his last college year, but had only
been home a few days when a burglar stole it! He
has taken the village school for $900 this year, studies
hard; and the faculty have voted, that, when he can
stand a certain examination, he shall take his degree.</p>

<p>It is for such students that Antioch is open. One-third
of her present pupils are women. Pleasant
levees are held once a fortnight at the president's
house, where the two sexes mingle gracefully. The
girls have a literary society, which they call the Crescent;
the young men, two societies, the Star and the
Adelphian. The Star and the Crescent have fitted up
one room under the gambrel very tastefully. The
Adelphians rival them. The folding-doors in the hall
of the latter society open into a pretty alcove, where
a good library is beginning. These two rooms are
the only glimpse of tasteful, home-like comfort that
one gets in any public room at Antioch. I attended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
the meetings of the three societies. Before the
Crescents, I heard a graceful little essay on "A
Rail-fence," from a girl of fifteen. From the Stars,
I heard a discussion of Roman funerals. The Adelphians
discussed the possibility of obeying an unrighteous
law, very much as I have heard their elders
do in Congress. Each society had a censor, who took
notes of papers and discussions, and quietly criticised
each performance when it ended. It was noticeable,
that the performances of the women, making due
allowance for age and opportunity, were far more
graceful and able than those of the men, and a most
valuable help to the latter. Coming home one night
from the Adelphians, I found at Dr. Hosmer's a
Southern refugee, who is educating her children at
Antioch.</p>

<p>Sometime before the war, Mrs. Palmer and her
husband went to East Tennessee from New York,
carrying with them $50,000. I think they must have
opened a store; for she spoke of having on hand a
valuable stock of millinery and medicines. Being
Northerners, they were constantly threatened, and at
last consented to barricade their house. Three times
the rebels stole their horse, a colt only two years old;
and three times Mrs. Palmer's perseverance got it
back. At last they surrounded the house at night,
firing on the peaceable inmates; and Mr. Palmer, attempting
to escape over the roof, got three bullets in
his arm. The next day the party came back, robbed
the house, and burned up the stores. The medicine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
was a great loss: there was no more within reach for
rebel or loyalist. Mrs. Palmer succeeded in hiding
her meat and meal. For eight days she and her
family hid in the rocks, only venturing back to the
house at night to cook and eat a little food. One
night, when the poor wife was so employed, her feverish,
half-delirious husband followed her, and, in some
way, attracted the attention of the enemy. A terrible
battle followed, and Mr. Palmer lay on the kitchen
floor with eight wounds in his body. When the malice
of the rebels was spent, Mrs. Palmer went out
with her children, and called the cattle. By keeping
them between her and the house, she succeeded in
getting her husband into the woods. A Union man
finally received and fed him; but it was many days
before his wounds could be dressed. She then escaped
with her children and the colt, on which they
rode by turns. She had picked up some of the ends
of her burnt millinery, which she used to barter for
food as they went along. She came at last to an
old schoolhouse, where she lay down; and here she
nursed her children through the measles. Here, after
many weeks, her husband came to see her, but was
taken prisoner as he crept away, and was sent to
Libby. She saw many terrible things while she lingered
here: one of her neighbors had his bowels cut
out while he was still alive! When she started
afresh, she had seven hundred miles to travel before
she reached Bardstown. One of her five children ultimately
died of the fatigue and hunger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<p>"How did you get food?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I prayed for it," she answered; "and I always felt
sure of enough for the hour."</p>

<p>"Who would shelter you?" I continued.</p>

<p>"I never lay out but one night," she answered. "I
used to tell them, wherever I went, that the Union
soldiers must win in the end; that I was going to
them, and would report whoever used me ill. So they
would let me lie on the kitchen floor." At Bardstown,
Morgan's men destroyed her last thing; and then a
United-States sutler found her, and carried her to
Louisville.</p>

<p>The children of many such women will hereafter
seek Antioch. Let them find there a generous provision.</p>


<h5>VASSAR COLLEGE.</h5>

<p>Mr. Vassar's magnificent donation is drawing interest
at last; and, though I do not feel as much confidence
in any institution founded for women alone
as I do in mixed colleges, we ought all to be grateful
for the advanced standard lifted at Poughkeepsie.</p>

<p>Malt has always been a beneficent agent in the
civilization of mankind. Ever since Mr. Thrale
looked kindly on old Sam Johnson, brewers have
seemed to have a generous pride in conquering
human selfishness, and leaving something better than
a family of children to interest posterity. Mr. John
Guy, of Liverpool, a wealthy brewer without children,
founded there the great "Guy's Hospital." He
was the great-uncle of Matthew Vassar, also a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
brewer in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. By and by, Matthew
Vassar found his property close upon a million; and,
as he had no children, he began to think what he
should do with it. He had a good many poor relations,
and those who were industrious and deserving
he did not forget. One of them, a young niece, supported
herself by school-teaching. He built her a
schoolhouse, and did what he thought right to ease
her way. At last, sinking in a decline, she came home
to die. As she lay on the sofa, day after day, she
watched him walking back and forth, and talking over
his plans. Now and then she would say gently,
"Uncle Matthew, do something for women." After
she was gone, Matthew Vassar went to see Guy's
Hospital. His connections advised him not to give
away his money. His Baptist friends in Edinburgh
and Liverpool laughed at the idea of a college for
women, which had already entered his mind. He
came home, and tried to plan a hospital; he got up,
and went to bed with the idea uppermost; but all the
time he seemed to hear the voice of his niece, "Do
something for women, Uncle Matthew." Mr. Vassar
has two houses: one, in the heart of Poughkeepsie,
which is opposite the brewery, and, with a long range
of comfortable outbuildings, looks as steadfast and
English as ever Mr. Thrale's own house could do; the
other, a modest little country box, set on a hill among
extensive grounds, and commanding, from various
points, lovely views of the town and river. The peculiarity
of this place is, that it is ornamented with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
manner of punchinellos cut in dull gray limestone, and
leering or grinning from every corner of the park. I
did not find out who was responsible for this grim
joke. In 1860, Mr. Vassar, with the humility and
common sense which belong to his character, obtained
a charter, and called together thirty trustees. To them
he transferred more than half his actual property.
When the opening of the war occasioned the failure
of the contractors, he did not draw back, but gladly
gave the additional $150,000 which the increased expense
demanded.</p>

<p>The building is planned after the palace of the
Tuilleries, having at each end the chateau roof and
mansard windows. It is 500 feet long, and 170 deep.
The only drawback to its architectural effect is the
entrance, which should have been a magnificent double
stairway, but is, for the present, only an ordinary
private door. This building stands in the midst of
two hundred acres of lovely sloping and swelling
land. To the right, and quite visible at the porter's
lodge, is the gymnasium and hippodrome under one
roof; to the left, the graceful observatory, which is
also the home of Miss Mitchell and her father.</p>

<p>In the two wings of the building with chateau roofs
are five private dwellings, rented for a moderate sum
to the resident professors. In the centre, just behind
the entrance, are the dining-hall, the chapel, the art-gallery,
and the library; also the large drawing-rooms,
where pupils and teachers receive their friends, and
the parlor and office of president and principal. Connecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
this centre with each wing, on four floors, run
long corridors with sunshine and bright windows on
one side, and clusters of students' rooms and recitation-rooms
on the other. The rooms are in pretty
groups of four. Three bedrooms open into one study,
the latter made pleasant and home-like by the united
treasures of the occupants. The music-rooms are
"deadened," so that the noise hardly strays beyond the
walls; and the cabinet, where the students in natural
history prepare specimens, is full of cases to preserve
the work. The best that I can say of the building
will hardly do justice to the intention of the founder,
which no one can comprehend who has seen only such
institutions as Harvard and Yale. There is no occasion
here to wish for any thing which may perhaps
come when the college is rich enough. Mr. Vassar's
intention was and is to have the endowment perfect.
The building is fire-proof, every partition wall being
of solid brick. There are four pairs of fire-walls, into
which iron doors run on rollers; and between these
are fire-proof stairways, always safe, even if the wood
work should catch fire. There is the physiological
cabinet, with every thing for the use of the professor,
including various manikins and wax preparations.
The library, chiefly of books of reference, holds three
thousand volumes, to be increased at the rate of five
hundred per annum, and is also used as a reading-room,
where newspapers and reviews may always be
found. The art-gallery, purchased at an extra cost of
$20,000, is such as no college in the country possesses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
It consists of good copies in oil, fine water-colors,
including six real Turners, large portfolios of original
sketches, and a perfect library of works on art and
engravings,&mdash;in all, about a thousand volumes. Besides
the five hundred pictures, this gallery contains a
few busts and casts; among them, Palmer's Sappho in
marble, an ancient wrought brazen shield, and specimens
of ancient stained glass. The chapel seats seven
hundred persons, and might hold a thousand. Over
the altar is a beautiful copy of the Dresden Madonna,
by Miss Church, of New York. There is also a fine
organ.</p>

<p>The music-rooms accommodate a "conservatory"
on the Charles Auchester plan, as well as separate
pupils. Thirty-two pianos are in use.</p>

<p>The building on the outside is laid with brick in
black cement, and has dark stone trimmings, which
prevent its glaring on the eye like a new brick
building. To the right is the riding-school, one
hundred feet by sixty, where thirty horses are kept;
and, in the same building, a gymnastic hall, thirty
feet by seventy.</p>

<p>The observatory, eighty feet long and fifty high,
rests on the rock, as well as the great pier. It contains
a telescope made by Fitz, whose focal length is seventeen
feet, and its object-glass is twelve and a half inches.
There is also a smaller instrument, for the constant
use of pupils, and, on the roof, a good comet-seeker.
There is a beautiful transit circle, made by James, of
Philadelphia, which Miss Mitchell considers invaluable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
of its kind; and a very perfect sidereal clock and
chronograph, from the Bonds of Boston.</p>

<p>Between the observatory and the riding-school, four
hundred feet from the main building, is the gas and
boiler building, from which the college is lighted and
warmed. Beside these, twenty miles of water-pipe
travel up and down the corridors to supply culinary
and domestic needs. Let us follow them into the
kitchen, and we shall find there every possible convenience
of a good hotel, to the steam-filled table on
which the food is carved.</p>

<p>And now, the building once ready for its inmates,
was Mr. Vassar rewarded for the sacrifice he had
made? for all the time and thought bestowed on the
outfit? No one had supposed that the school would
be full when it opened in September, 1865; but there
were 353 pupils on hand the first day, and the work
of organizing was no trifle. When I looked at the
teachers and principals in this institution, many of
whom I had known before visiting it, it seemed to me
that each one had been providentially fitting for the
very work Mr. Vassar now offered. Of the thirty persons
employed, I saw no one that I should have desired
to change. Maria Mitchell, Hannah Lyman, and the
admirable resident physician, Alida Avery, are now
too well known to need any praise of mine. These
persons are all of the faculty; and their names indicate
how liberal all the decisions of the faculty must
be. I visited the institution at the beginning of the second
year, in October, 1866. It had already outrun its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
bounds. There was talk of still another dormitory.
Four hundred pupils, well born, well bred, in good
health, with more than ordinary education (for the
tests are severe), and with ample means, had come to
meet those teachers. They had come, between the
ages of seventeen and twenty-two, at the very time
when society holds out every attraction. Vassar is no
charity school. Its necessary fees amount to four
hundred dollars; and a girl should have six hundred
to feel happy and at ease. It paid every bill the first
year, but had nothing left for repairs and additions.
To create a fund for this purpose, the fees have been
increased to the above-named sum. When the first
rush of pupils occurred, Mr. Vassar was almost dismayed.
"God sometimes gives great thoughts to
very little men," he said, and trembled; but, when the
year came to a close, he lifted his hands in serene
gratitude. I arrived at night; and the procession
filing past me to enter the handsome dining-hall,
supported by light pillars, about which were circular
stands for the urns, occupied seven minutes. When
I saw more than four hundred young women seated
in groups of twenty, saw them bow their handsome
heads in silent grace,&mdash;a suggestion which came, I
think, from Miss Mitchell's Quaker father,&mdash;I felt excited
with happiness. After tea, I walked round and
through the groups of tables; and the bright faces
smiled back at me either consciousness or question.
When they left the dining-hall, they went to the
chapel, where Miss Lyman offers an evening prayer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
and, no gentlemen being present, talks to the ladies
in reference to all matters of decorum; a practice
I hope to see followed at Antioch. After breakfast
the next morning, I went to President Raymond's
short matin service, and then walked over to the observatory.
There I saw the graceful figures of the
girls bending to the instrument, as they recorded the
spots on the sun. I saw the daily diagrams in which
they had recorded the position of these spots for the
last year, and other diagrams of lunar eclipses. "Women
make better observers than men," said old Mr.
Mitchell. "They have more patience, more accuracy.
I had been observing thirty years, when Maria took it
up, and I thought, mebbe, 'twas only Maria; but it is
just the same with these girls. They do better than
I did." I don't wonder Miss Mitchell is proud of her
seventeen mathematical astronomers. She is a tender
daughter, as well as a capable "observer;" and she
would not come to Vassar without her father. All the
girls come to the white-haired old man with their joys
and troubles; and I saw a letter from an old pupil to
Miss Mitchell when I was there, which contained this
audacious sentence, left to tell its own story: "Was
it not good of God to put it into Mr. Vassar's heart
to spend his whole fortune in making your father's
last years perfectly happy?" In the art gallery I found,
one morning, twenty-five pupils copying; and, in the
musical conservatory, one hundred and seventy-five.
The gymnasium was not quite ready for use; so I
went down to see the girls rowing on the pretty lake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
After school hours, the floral clubs were busy in the
grounds. I cannot say any thing better of Professor
Tenney's pupils, than that they work over their specimens
as enthusiastically as boys. In chemical
analysis, under Professor Farrar, the girls are greatly
interested. The curriculum is such as we find adopted
at all colleges, except that far more time is devoted
to science than is usual at Yale or Harvard, and
room is left for music. Riding, driving, rowing,
&amp;c., are extras, only allowed in the time allotted to
out-door exercise. The resident physician, Dr. Avery,
in whom the college is conscious that it possesses a
great treasure, gives a regular course of physiological
lectures.</p>

<p>Matthew Vassar was seventy-six years old on the
29th of April, and that day is a perpetual festival for
the pupils. Could you see him meet the scholars in
the grounds, you would think them all his children. I
had interviews with the president, trustees, and the
teachers; but was most attracted toward this noble
old man. He told me that he meant to go on endowing
the college until he died. "Then," he said, "I
shall leave nothing for executors to quarrel about:
money will be safe in brick and stone." He asked me
to talk with him about a culinary and household college
for the proper training of housewives, which he
still wishes to erect. His last gift to the college was
its magnificent cabinet of stones and fossils; one of
the best, Professor Dana thinks, that he ever saw.
Beside the beautiful specimens shown under glass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
there are, in drawers beneath the glass cases, similar
specimens which may be handled.</p>

<p>In furnishing Vassar College, no one has had to
think what any thing would cost. When shall we
have an institution for wealthy persons, of both sexes,
with an outfit as splendid? It is a sight which Oberlin
has earned the right to see.</p>


<h5>LAWRENCE UNIVERSITY, KANSAS.</h5>

<p>But a still more interesting story is that connected
with the establishment of the State University in
Kansas. Its name will be seen on the list of colleges
which owe their existence to Oberlin. This university
is one of those whose <em>character</em> was determined by
the excitement the success of Oberlin had aroused;
but its <em>existence</em> was due to two ladies from Western
New York. It will have been seen, by some details
in the body of this work, that an attempt was made
to secure for woman a share in the noble State endowment
at "Ann Arbor," Michigan, but without
success. I will tell a part of the story in the language
of Miss Mary Chapin, then of Milwaukie, the
lady who, with the assistance of her sister, carried
the work out in Kansas.</p>

<p>"Some years ago," she says, "the Legislature of
Michigan decided that girls might be admitted as
pupils to the State University. The faculty of that
institution consulted the 'wise men of the East' on
the subject, and excluded women on the ground of
expediency. If it were necessary to make it a mixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
school, in order to admit them, perhaps they acted
wisely. It is no more just and wise to give the
charge of endowed schools for girls to men, than it
would be to put Harvard and Yale into the hands
of women. Girls need incentives to study, even more
than facilities for it. The fact, that the real education
of the boy begins where that of the woman ends, is
not so depressing as the 'hard work and low wages'
which await her as a teacher. In 1863, Kansas accepted
the grant of land from Congress for the endowment
of a State University. The citizens of Lawrence
secured its location in that city, by the gift of forty
acres for a site. The college was not organized; and
it seemed the time and place to decide whether women
should enter endowed schools on equal terms with
men, as pupils and teachers. Many of the most influential
men of Kansas thought it both just and expedient
to give women an equal share of the benefits of
the university, and voted for such a result. To obviate
the objection which closed the Michigan University
to women, a bill was drawn up, organizing a double
school; that for girls to be taught by women. Some
objection was made to this unusual provision, and the
time was too short to urge its necessity: so the bill
merely reads, that it <em>may</em> be taught by women. The
date of this law is February, 1864. A school-building
was finished last summer (1866), and the college
opened in September. The regents elected a president
and three professors at the outset, one of the
latter being a lady. There is some danger that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
two schools will become one, by an act of the Legislature.
If this occurs, nothing important is gained;
but, if the present organization continues, woman may
here show what a true feminine culture implies: for,
while woman differs widely from man, like him she
needs <em>development through her own work</em>."</p>

<p>I have altered none of the statements in this admirable
letter. It will be seen that Miss Chapin went
to Kansas, desiring to accomplish two things: she not
only wanted education, but position and <em>compensation</em>,
for women, from the State fund. I want these also;
but I only ask for the first, for I am certain the rest
will follow. Neither do I think it wise to insist that
women shall be taught only by women, until universities
have done the necessary work of preparation.
In all the colleges mentioned on the Oberlin list,
women are employed as teachers: there are already
a good number of professors of Greek and mathematics.
Nor is the welfare of <em>women</em> alone a sufficient
motive for me. I am satisfied, that humanity and
civilization gain, in the mixed college, more than either
sex can lose. It remains for me to give a few of the
personal details which Miss Chapin's modesty has
omitted. When she first thought it her duty to press
this matter, she knew that she must be in Lawrence,
in order to do the "talking" which must precede an
act of legislation in America. She corresponded with
Governor Robinson, in reference to a day-school in
Lawrence, and started with her sister to take charge
of it. On their way, they were startled by the terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
news of the Kansas raid. They hesitated for a little;
but, thank God, in spite of raids, the work of the
world goes on. Miss Mary went on herself in September,
and, after a week's residence, decided to defer
the opening of her school. In December, both sisters
went, and began their daily teaching, and the gentle
agitation which was to yield the great result. They
also tried, at the East, to raise money to realize at
once, on a small scale, their ideal of a practical course
of study for women, especially of a scientific school.
"Science," says Miss Chapin, "has not yet been
applied to the arts of domestic life. The ordering of
home, as a centre of comfort and culture, has yet to
be considered. Architecture has much to do with
civilization. The laws of health and the means of
social progress lie entirely in woman's province. Horticulture
will do more for her than calisthenics. She
is ready to do useful work, but has no means. A
very wasteful economy denies her this, to lavish thousands
on her folly and ostentation."</p>

<p>I cannot detail all the obstacles which Miss Chapin's
effort encountered. Mr. Charles Chadwick, of
Lawrence, drew up the bill; General Dietzler and
Governor Robinson pushed it. At the last moment,
the original bill was carried off in the pocket of an
opposing member; but the wit and quick memory of
a woman saved it.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned, that, after its passage, a
lady was elected professor, with a salary of $1,600,
and the same for her assistant. It is almost needless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
to say, this was Miss Caroline Chapin. She has not
yet accepted the position. The two sisters are at the
head of a high school in Quincy, Ill., which has this
peculiarity: there is attached to it a school in modelling,
under the charge of a professed sculptor.</p>

<p>In the first part of this volume, I have intimated
that a new effort has been made, sustained by the
pleading of Theodore Tilton, to open Michigan University
to female students. At the moment when
these pages go to press, it seems uncertain whether
this resolution will prevail with the present Legislature,
or whether a motion for a university for women,
under the same regents, will supersede it. The Greek
professor has practically solved the difficulty, by admitting
his own daughter to his classes, without asking
the faculty. This example was set him, years
ago, by Mr. Magill, in the Boston Latin School.</p>

<p>As these pages go to press, an anonymous statement
appears, to the effect that there have passed
examinations for the University of Cambridge, England,&mdash;Junior
boys, 1,126; Junior girls, 118; Senior
boys, 212; Senior girls, 84. It would seem that the
conditions of the opening of this university are hardly
understood. If I am right, these examinations confer
a certain rank on the female scholars, but do not admit
them afterward to the university.</p>


<h5>SCHOOL FOR NURSES.</h5>

<p>The most interesting educational movement, at
this moment, in that country, is Miss Nightingale's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
"Training-school for Nurses," which has been in operation
for three years in Liverpool. It was founded,
after a correspondence with her, in strict conformity
to her counsel. As a training-school, it may be said
to be self-supporting; but it is also a beneficent institution,
and, in that regard, is sustained by donations.
A most admirable system of district nursing is provided,
under its auspices, for the whole city of Liverpool,
all of whose suffering sick become, in this way,
the recipients of intelligent care, and of valuable instruction
in cooking and all sanitary matters. It is
too tempting an experiment to dwell upon, unless we
could follow it into its details. Its report occupies a
hundred and one pages.</p>

<p>It seems worth while to look into this report, and
examine in detail its method of dealing with sickness
among the poor. When Miss Nightingale drew especial
attention to the want of such schools in England
in 1861, some ladies and gentlemen in Liverpool came
together, and entered into correspondence with her.
Out of that correspondence grew the Liverpool school.
The Liverpool Infirmary, the most considerable hospital
in that city, entered into the plan, and offered its
wards for the instruction of the nurses. The society
proposed to itself three objects:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>1. To provide thoroughly trained nurses for hospitals.</p>

<p>2. To provide district or missionary nurses for the
poor.</p>

<p>3. To provide trained nurses for private families.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<p>Nowhere are hospital and private nurses so badly
trained as in England; and Miss Nightingale well
says that half the symptoms which are considered
symptoms of disease are, in reality, indications of a
want of air, light, warmth, quiet, or cleanliness, which
properly instructed nurses would know how to supply.
A want of punctuality in administering food, and of
watchful care in detecting its effects upon the patient,
create other classes of symptoms. The beer-drinking
habits of the people lead to much intoxication; and
we ourselves have seen ladies of quality lying on a
sick-bed, where they suffered for the attention which
a thoroughly stupefied nurse was incapable of giving.
No amount of wealth, as Miss Nightingale testifies,
can secure such nurses as wealthy patients often need,
and for which a thorough hospital-training is required.
The society strengthens her appeal by extracts from
Dr. Howson's paper, read at the meeting of the Social
Science Association in 1858.</p>

<p>The Liverpool school has erected a building, to
carry out its purpose, eighty-five feet by forty. It
has three stories, each of them eleven feet high; and,
by a single glance at the plans which accompany the
pamphlet, one sees that the arrangements for bathing
and ventilation are what those of our new city hospital
ought to be. One lady superintendent, with three
servants, has charge of this building. It has thirty-one
nurses under training. By the wages which they
earn in the second and third years, the expenses of
this Home are nearly paid, leaving a margin of about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
three hundred pounds to be supplied by donations. It
is expected to be a self-supporting institution, except so
far as it becomes a benevolent charity, by supplying to
the poor, food and nursing. When the institution was
ready to begin its work, the lady superintendent having
been some months in training at St. John's College and
the London Hospital, where the nurses educated by
the Nightingale Fund are to be found, took possession
of her building. Her head-nurses had been thoroughly
educated. Pupils then offered: they were engaged for
three years, the first year to be strictly probationary.
Each head-nurse was to take charge of an entire ward
of the hospital, to be responsible for the medicines
and stimulants, always assisted by one pupil. Each
pupil went first for two months to a surgical ward;
then for two to the medical; then four at the surgical,
and four again at the medical,&mdash;one course helping
the other, and both filling the entire year under a
thoroughly trained head. For the next two years, the
pupil is employed without such superintendence wherever
need is; and, for each of the three years, receives,
in addition to board and lodgings, seventy dollars.
At the Home there is a good library, and evening
classes are held for the disengaged pupils. A superannuation
fund has been started, to encourage
respectable women to enter the Home. At the end
of the third year, the Home has twenty-eight pupils
under training, fourteen hospital nurses, fourteen district
or gratuitous nurses, and ten employed in private
families.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span></p>

<p>This gives an idea of the training process; but our
chief interest lies in the district nursing. As soon as
the Home had nurses it felt willing to trust, one of
the experiments recommended by Miss Nightingale
was tried. The wife of a Scripture-reader undertook
to prepare sago, necessaries, &amp;c.; the clergyman of
the parish furnished a list of patients, and a central
lodging for the nurse. The Home sent her out, supplied
with cushions, blankets, and bed-rests. She
went into the families, showed them what to do, and
helped with her own hands. At the end of the first
week, she came back, crying and begging to be relieved;
she thought she never could bear the sight of
the misery she encountered. But, in a short time, she
was so strengthened by seeing the results of her labor,
that she positively refused to take employment among
the rich. It is easy to see what great advantages wait
on this form of charity. As instruction is precisely
what she comes to give, the poor cannot resent this
from the nurse; she fears no imposition, for she is in
the house at all hours of the day and night; her little
gifts do not wound, but cheer like neighborly kindnesses.
It is Miss Nightingale's idea, that such nursing
is a far greater good than the establishment of hospitals.
In six months, this nurse found two cases where
the prolonged sickness of the wife had made drunkards
of two otherwise steady husbands, and brought
their families to the brink of ruin. The wives were
cured, the husbands reformed, the families saved. A
leaf from her report of cases will show what she did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>1. <em>Asthma and bed-sores.</em>&mdash;Lying on a floor; so thin, had
to lift her on a sheet. Dirt, bad air: two children. Husband
said he "was forsaken by God and man." Our nurse
goes in, washes her, changes linen; lends bedstead and bedding,
and air-cushions; cleans and whitewashes. The woman
now sits up, and the man is again hopeful.</p>

<p>2. <em>Internal cancer.</em>&mdash;Nurse attended to the surgical operation,
and administration of subsequent remedies. The woman
is now at work.</p>

<p>3. <em>Paralysis.</em>&mdash;Nurse attended; gave instruction and food.
Recovery complete.</p>

<p>4. A girl&mdash;as the doctor said&mdash;in a consumption. Hospital
refused her as incurable. Beef-tea, wine, sago, and cod-liver
oil supplied; and, in one month, she could walk to the
nurse's lodging.</p></blockquote>

<p>Out of all this success, the perfect plan developed.
It had been proved, that the poor were willing to be
taught <em>how</em> to nurse, and to keep their houses clean;
that intense distress might be mitigated, and coming
poverty arrested. It was also proved, that the nurse
so employed could notify the health commissioners of
incipient epidemics, and obtain for ignorant tenants,
in return, necessary whitewashing, drainage, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The city of Liverpool was now divided into eighteen
districts, each of which, for practical convenience, was
made to correspond to two church cures. The Home
undertook to furnish a nurse to each district, provided
it would elect for itself a lady superintendent, and
raise a subscription for food, medicines, and necessaries.
As soon as the superintendent is found, meetings
are held to interest the district; each district<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
having an average population of twenty-four thousand
and over. A central lodging is then to be
supplied for the nurse, and the district must furnish,
for loan and use, the following articles:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>One iron bedstead, six pairs of sheets, six blankets, cushions,
bed-gowns, shirts, flannels, wine, meat, sago, bread, coals,
arrow-root, preserves, and vinegar.</p></blockquote>

<p>If any thing excites one's envy in the current expenses,
it is the amount of coals required. To think
of warming forty people for one year for twenty-six
pounds!</p>

<p>The superintendent is supplied with a map of the
district, forms of recommendation, rules for patients
and nurses, and slates and pencils to be hung at the
head-board, to receive the directions of the doctor, and
the inquiries of the nurse. In seven of the districts,
the lady superintendents furnish the supplies at their
own cost! How gladly ought any wealthy woman to
avail herself of so sure a method! A strong woman is
hired for scrubbing; and very often the first thing a
nurse does is to demand whitewashing and repairs of
the Board of Health. In each district, a person is
provided to cook the necessary food; the nurse giving
notice, through the superintendent, of her wants. The
nurse herself confers with the doctors, waits on the
surgeons, changes and cleanses the patient, and administers
poultices, blisters, leeches, enemas, and the
like. One Liverpool lady defrays the whole cost of
washing the loaned linen for the eighteen districts!
A registry of it is kept by the nurse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span></p>

<p>We need not be surprised to find that this admirable
plan has such marked success, that all the Liverpool
charities are eager to play into its hands. Each
district superintendent is appointed locally; but the
Home has an out-door inspector, who looks after the
district nurses. The superintendents make quarterly
reports to the Home, and hold meetings of conference
by themselves.</p>

<p>There is, at the seaside town of Southport, a hospital,
which furnishes sea-bathing to invalids.</p>

<p>The Committee of Central Relief for the city of
Liverpool are so delighted with this nursing charity,
that they have already offered butcher's meat, three
weeks of seaside bathing at Southport, and coals and
money to any convalescing patient when deemed
needful. The workingmen's dining-rooms offer, on
proper application, warm dinners to convalescents;
and the Home, through its inspector, superintendents,
and nurses, makes sure there is no waste nor misuse.</p>

<p>The statistics for 1864 were as follows:&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">Apparently cured</td><td align="right">936</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Partially restored</td><td align="right">456</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>Such a record as this makes one wish to emigrate
to the land where such things are done. The rapid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
increase of the charity may be judged from the fact,
that, in the previous year, only one thousand seven hundred
and seventy-six patients were <em>treated</em>, and only
six hundred and seventy-two were <em>cured</em>. This report
comes to us with a letter and notes from Miss Nightingale.
It is prepared with the most beautiful modesty.
The names of the paid officers are given; but
we cannot tell from its pages whose were the kind
hearts and clear heads which first responded to Miss
Nightingale's call. Nowhere has benevolent action
accomplished so much as in Great Britain. Such a
work as this may well challenge the gratitude and
admiration of the world.</p>

<p>The "Arnott Scholarship" of Queen's College,
London,&mdash;founded by Mrs. Arnott in 1865, for the
promotion of the study of natural philosophy, and
the highest scholarship open to women in England&mdash;has
just been gained by Miss Matilda Ballard, a
young lady of seventeen, daughter of Dr. W.R. Ballard,
a native of New York, and, for some years, the
leading American dentist in London. The prize,
the money value of which is not far from two hundred
dollars, consists of one year's free instruction and
perpetual free admission to certain lectures, always
interesting and instructive.</p>

<p>The ladies' classes at Oxford have proved a great
success, and the committee have just issued a programme
for the present term. The course of instruction
includes Latin, French, Arithmetic, Euclid,
German, &amp;c. The Rev. W.C. Sedgwick, M.A.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
Fellow and Tutor of Merton College, has undertaken
to deliver a course of lectures on the Italian Republics
of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>On the 26th of October, 1864, a Working-women's
College was opened in London, with an address from
Miss F.R. Malleson. It is governed by a council of
teachers. In addition to the ordinary branches, it
offers instruction in botany, physiology, and drawing.
Its fee is four shillings a year; and the Coffee
and Reading Room, about which its social life centres,
is open every evening from seven to eleven.</p>

<p>In France, the Imperial Geographical Society,
which is, in a certain sense, a college, has lately admitted
to membership Madame Dora d'Istra as the
successor to Madame Pfeiffer. Madame d'Istra had
distinguished herself by researches in the Morea.</p>

<p>In Calcutta, Miss Mary Carpenter has been starting
schools for Hindoo women, free from all religious
character or sectarian denomination.</p>


<h5>DEACONESSES' INSTITUTIONS.</h5>

<p>This seems the proper place also to insert some
details about schools like those at Kaiserworth, which
I could not procure in an authentic form in 1858.
The Kaiserworth school opened under Dr. Fliedner,
in 1822, with "one table, two beds, a chair, and one
discharged prisoner"! In 1852, the King of Prussia
laid the foundation of a home for the aged deaconesses
who have served as teachers and nurses.</p>

<p>The school at Strasburg, under Pastor Härber,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
began, in 1842, with one sister from a higher rank
of life. It undertakes to train servants, and is chiefly
under women's control. Assistance is also given to
clergymen in seeking out cases of temporal and spiritual
distress, in detecting imposture, in attending the
sick in their own houses, in teaching the poor how to
nurse and how to cook, in promoting the attendance
of children at school, in co-operating with charitable institutions
to superintend sewing and mending schools,
in influencing, for good, factory girls and servants;
and, in the hospital at Mühausen, the women taught
here make up bandages and prescriptions, cook for the
poor and sick, receive the patients, and do out-door
visiting. At Basle, there is a Deaconess House, under
the charge of a daughter of a Basle manufacturer. It
looks after the laboring classes, and provides for the
sick.</p>

<p>The house opened at St. Loup, under Pastor Germond,
in 1842, takes charge of sick children. At
Geneva, a deaconess has had charge for six years;
through whom five hundred servants get their places,
and with whom they find homes when out of health
or work. In 1859, twenty-one were nursed in the
institution.</p>

<p>A house in the Faubourg St. Antoine, Paris, was
proposed by M. Vermeil, in 1830. In 1840, Mademoiselle
Malvesin offered to conduct it; her letter to
Vermeil, and his to her, crossing each other. Holland
and Sweden have opened several of these schools. In
our own country, the Rev. Mr. Passevant, a Lutheran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
minister of Pittsburg, Pa., is establishing hospitals in
every State, under the care of women. They are
supported by contributions in all the city churches,
except the Catholic. These hospitals are under the
care of a sisterhood, who cannot, <em>as yet</em>, compete
with the Sisters of Charity. It seems to me, that
Mr. Passevant has erred in a most noble work, by
drawing his sisters from the <em>uncultivated</em> classes.
Such a work should bear the right stamp in the
beginning. In Western Pennsylvania, also, Bishop
Kerfoot has begun the noble work of endowing his
whole diocese with suitable high schools for girls,
where they may obtain at home, for one hundred dollars
annually, what it would cost five times as much
to procure at a distance.</p>


<h5>MEDICAL EDUCATION.</h5>

<p>As regards medical education, we know of two
colleges, or, rather, of one college and one hospital,
in Boston, where education is given. There is one in
Springfield, and one in Philadelphia. We should be
glad to get more statistics of this kind; for Cleveland,
where Dr. Zakrzewska took her degree, is no
longer open to female students, and Geneva is contenting
herself with the honor of having graduated
Dr. Blackwell. Nine women were graduated at the
New-York Medical School for Women, in February of
this year. Professor Willis then stated that there are
three hundred female physicians in the country, earning
incomes of from ten to twenty thousand dollars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a female medical society in London. This
society wishes to open the way for thorough medical
instruction, which will entitle its graduates to a degree
from Apothecaries' Hall; and it offered lectures from
competent persons, in 1864, upon obstetrics and general
medical science. Madame Aillot's Hospital of the
Maternity, in Paris, still offers its great advantages to
women; of which two of our countrywomen, Miss
Helen Morton and Miss Lucy E. Sewall, have taken
creditable advantage. They are both of them Massachusetts
girls. Miss Morton is retained in Paris,
and Miss Sewall is the resident physician of the Hospital
for Women and Children, in Boston.</p>

<p>At present, to obtain thorough instruction in any
branch, women are obliged to pay exorbitant prices,
and receive, as the results of their training, but half-wages.
In Boston, Dr. Zakrzewska has again unsuccessfully
asked permission to become a member of the
Massachusetts Medical Society. Many physicians,
however, extend the fellowship which the institution
denies, and the "Medical Journal" expresses itself
courteously on this point. Efforts, sustained by the
influential name of the Hon. Charles G. Loring, are
at this moment making to secure the advantages of
the Harvard-College lectures to women intending to
become physicians.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>In 1863, there existed in St. Petersburg a stringent
regulation, which prohibited women from following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
the university courses. A Miss K., who had a decided
taste for medicine, without the means to pay for instruction,
applied for such instruction to the authorities
of Orenburg. Orenburg is partly in Europe and
partly in Asia, and its territory includes the Cossack
races of the Ural. These people have a superstitious
prejudice against male physicians, and are chiefly
attended in illness by sorceresses. Miss K. offered
to put her medical knowledge at the service of the
Cossacks, and received permission to attend the Academy
of Medicine. The Cossacks promised her an
annual stipend of twenty-eight roubles; but, when she
passed the half-yearly examination as well as the male
students, they sent her three hundred roubles as a
token of good-will!</p>

<p>In France, a Mademoiselle Reugger, from Algeria,
lately passed a brilliant examination, and received the
degree of Bachelor of Letters. She appealed to the
Dean of the Faculty at Montpellier for permission to
follow the regular course, and was refused on account
of her sex. She then turned to the Minister of Public
Instruction, who granted it, on condition that she
should pledge herself to practise only in Algeria,
where the Arabs, like the Cossacks, refuse the attendance
of male physicians. Unlike our Russian friend,
she refused to give the pledge. She threw herself
upon her rights, and appealed in person to the emperor.
This was in December last, and I have not
been able to find his decision. It was doubtless given
in her behalf; for Louis Napoleon will always yield,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
as a favor, what he would stubbornly refuse as a
right.</p>

<p>A female medical mission is to be despatched to
Delhi, for the same reason. The physicians sent out
are,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>1. To attend native ladies in the Zenanas.</p>

<p>2. To set on foot a dispensary for women only.</p>

<p>3. To train native women as nurses.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of the medical profession, it should be stated, for
the encouragement of women, that there are over
three hundred graduates from the several medical colleges
for women; and that there is scarcely a village
throughout the country but has its woman physician,
of greater or less skill. In New-York City, there are
many successful physicians beside the Drs. Blackwell.
Dr. Lozier has a practice of $15,000, and owns two
fine houses, earned by her own perseverance. In
Orange, N.J., Dr. Fowler is very popular, and has a
paying practice of $5,000 a year. In Philadelphia is
Dr. Hannah Longshore, with a practice worth $10,000
per annum; then there are Drs. Preston, Tressel, Sartain,
Cleveland, and Myres, with incomes ranging
from $5,000 to $2,000. In Utica, N.Y., Dr. Pamela
Bronson is a successful physician. In Albion is Dr.
Vail; in Weedsport, Dr. Harriet E. Seeley. In
Rochester, Dr. Sarah Dolley numbers among her
patrons many persons of wealth and fashion, who,
but a few years ago, ridiculed the idea of a "female
physician." Mrs. Dolley's practice brings her fully
$3,000 a year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Gleason of Elmira, Dr. Ivison of Ithaca, and
Dr. Green, late of Clifton Springs, who has opened a
water-cure somewhere in Western New York, all have
a large amount of practice, and prescribe with the
greatest acceptance for those who favor hydropathic
treatment.</p>

<p>At Milwaukee, in the autumn of 1866, I found Dr.
Ross. She is one of the consulting physicians of the
Passevant Hospital and of the Orphans' Home. She
has practised with steadily increasing reputation for
ten years. She understands what is due to her position,
and has had a hard struggle with the empirical
women of the medical profession that crowd the great
thoroughfares of the West. But she would neither
lower her fees nor abate her requirements to compete
with this class. She came of the best surgical blood.
Her grandmother was Mercy Warren, married to
Darling Huntress, of Newbury, and first cousin to
General Warren, of Bunker's Hill. Our famous Boston
surgeons of the same family might be proud of
her reputation. She has established her practice and
her character, and would agree with all that I have
stated in the body of this book in regard to the great
need of medical societies to guard the position of
well-educated physicians, which is now at the mercy
of a worthless college diploma. Dr. Ross goes to the
Paris Exposition of this year (1867), as an agent for
the State of Wisconsin. She deserves the honor;
and the State has done itself credit by the choice.
The professional position of the physicians at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
New-England Hospital for Women and Children in
Boston, is also a matter for general congratulation.</p>

<p>The English Female Medical Society reports (June,
1866) twenty students and good results.</p>

<p>The physicians of this country have been occupied
this winter in discussing the discovery, by one of their
number, of the active infectant in fever and ague. It
has been found in the dust-like spores of a marsh
plant, the Pamella. In Paris, at the same time, a
woman of rank claims to have discovered the cause
of cholera, in a microscopic insect, developed in low
and filthy localities. Her details were so minute,
that the Academy of Science, which began by laughing
at the introduction of the matter, has been
compelled to listen; and the subject is now under
investigation.</p>


<h5>THE PULPIT.</h5>

<p>A very interesting account has lately been published
of Amélie von Braum, an educated Swedish
lady, the daughter of an army officer. She began to
preach in 1843, at Carlshamm, where she lived, in the
lowest dens of vice and misery. She carried with
her a clean cloth and lighted candles, which give
a festive impulse to the Swedish mind; and her
serious words produced an extraordinary effect. In
1856 she removed to Stockholm, and was earnestly
entreated to go to Dalecadin, and instruct the people.
From that time, she has acted as an itinerant evangelist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
preaching in summer in the open air. People
listen to her for hours in rapt attention.</p>

<p>In Sweden, there is also Mamsell Berg,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> a brave
young woman, who thought herself moved by the
Holy Spirit to teach the young Laps. She could not
get away from the thought that she ought to do it.
A clergyman, to whom she spoke upon the matter,
counselled her wisely: "Endeavor to shake off the
feeling; if you cannot, then accept it as a vocation
from God, and try it for six months." She said, "If
I go, it shall not be for six months, but for three
years." She went; and the three years became seven.
She seems also to have been a noble and beautiful
creature. She gathered the children around her, under
the most difficult circumstances, expending her
little property in putting up a schoolhouse for them,
and laying in sacks of potatoes, that she might feed
the half-famishing; learning herself the Laplandish
language, teaching them the Swedish, and discoursing
to them about the love of God.</p>

<p>In spite of the bitter words of warning which John
Ruskin has thought it his duty to speak to such
women as enter upon theological studies, a good
many women in Great Britain and this country have
engaged in what is properly the work of the Christian
ministry. The only ordained minister whose
work has come under our notice since the marriage
of Antoinette Blackwell is the Rev. Olympia Brown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
settled over the Universalist Society at Weymouth
Landing, Mass., and lately called to Newburgh in
New York. Her ministry has been highly successful,
and is to be mentioned here chiefly on account of a
legal decision to which it has given rise. The church
at Weymouth Landing made an appeal to the Legislature,
last winter, as to the legality of marriages
solemnized by her. The Legislature gave the same
general construction to the masculine relatives in the
enactment which the English law gave to the old
Latin word in the charter of Apothecaries' Hall; deciding
that marriages so solemnized are legal, and no
further legislation necessary.</p>

<p>Mention, too, should be made of Rev. Lydia A.
Jenkins, who has been a successful preacher among
the Universalists for the last eight or ten years, and is
now settled at Binghamton, N.Y.</p>

<p>Very recently, during the illness of her husband,
the minister at Bethesda Chapel, Newcastle, England,
a Mrs. Booth occupied the pulpit, to the great interest
and profit of the congregation. Among the Methodists
and "Christians,"<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> as well as among the Quakers,
women have always been received as preachers. In
October, 1866, I found a Mrs. Timmins settled as the
pastor of Ebenezer Church, three miles from Yellow
Springs, Ohio, where she had been for three years.
Ann Rexford is mentioned as an effective preacher
among the Christians. Her preaching attracted large
crowds in the State of New Jersey, some thirty years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
ago.</p>

<p>But the most remarkable record, if we except those
to be found among the Quakers, of any single
woman's work in the ministry, is that of Abigail Hoag
Roberts, who was the settled minister of a church
built for her at Milford, N.J., and who died in 1841,
at the age of forty-nine.</p>

<p>With her ministry is interlinked that of two other
women,&mdash;that of Nancy Gore Cram, of Weare,
N.H., and a Mrs. Hedges. Mrs. Cram began life as
a Free-will Baptist, and undertook a mission to the
Oneida Indians. The spiritual destitution of Central
New York in the year 1812 affected her profoundly.
Not a preacher of her own denomination
in New Hampshire could be induced to go there.
Disappointed in them, she hurried to Woodstock, Vt.,
and laid the case before a conference of "Christian"
elders and ministers, then in session. They understood
her better. She hurried back to the field she
had left; and, when the ministers followed her, they
were astonished at her work. A church was built for
her at Ballston Spa. She is described as a delicate,
blue-eyed woman, with dark hair, dressing plainly in
black silk, with her hair in a silk net; her whole
appearance and manner befitting her work. She died
in 1816, suddenly, in the fortieth year of her age.
Mrs. Roberts was one of her converts,&mdash;a woman
who was a constant preacher, from June, 1814, to
the June of 1841, in which she died, and, for many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
years, a settled pastor over the church at Milford,
where a monument has been erected to her. More
than once she defended the unity of God in public
discussion with the clergy, whom she brought to
ignominious defeat. She travelled through the three
States of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania,
where her name is still a household word. More than
once, she was threatened by her own sex with "tar
and feathers." She seems to have been, like Ann
Hutchinson, a witty woman. "If you feel called to
preach," said one minister to her, "why do you not
go to the heathen?"&mdash;"So far as I can judge," she
answered, "I am in the midst of them." She had a
large family of children, and was distinguished for
her household skill. She was quite famed for delicate
clear-starching, and, on one occasion, wove with a
hand-shuttle twenty-four yards of woollen cloth between
early morning and nine o'clock at night.
Many people sought her for information. Disliking
one woman's vulgarity, she said to her, "If you believe
in the Holy Ghost, why not use the <em>language</em>
that the Holy Ghost uses?" She was a great sufferer
in her latter years, but continued to preach at the
Milford church, where she had four hundred communicants,
and a congregation, at times, of twelve hundred
persons, even after she was compelled to lean
upon a staff. The Rev. Eli Fay preached her funeral
sermon, and bore testimony to her great ability. The
life from which I have drawn these particulars was
written by her son, and printed at Irvington, N.J.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p>Her colleague, Mrs. Hedges, died before her; but a
singular anecdote is related of her. She was exercised
with some doubts as to the separate existence
of the soul, and besought God in prayer to satisfy her
mind. It seemed to her, after retiring to rest, that
her soul left her body, passed through locked doors,
and found several unusual adjustments of furniture in
the house, and at last returned to the pale form upon
the bed. She rose happy, but, on trying to prove her
vision, found every thing in its usual place. A thorough
inquiry in the household, however, showed that
the changes she had observed had actually occurred
in the night, and continued for some time. Her experience
was the not uncommon one of the Seeress of
Prevorst.</p>

<p>It will be remembered, that, in the first edition of
"Woman's Right to Labor," I proposed a deaconess
in every church; and I found, the other day, a little
record in reference to the old church at Amsterdam,
in Holland, which I copy here:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"In the church at Amsterdam, there were about three hundred
communicants; and they had for pastors two admirable
men, Smith and Robertson, and four ruling elders, as well as
one aged woman as deaconess, who served them many years,
though she was sixty years old when she was chosen. She
filled her office honorably, and was an honor to the congregation.
She sat commonly in a convenient place in the church,
with a little birchen rod in her hand, and held the little children
in much awe, so that they disturbed not the assembly.
She diligently visited the sick and the infirm, especially
women, and called on younger sisters, in case of need, to</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>watch over them at night, and to give other assistance that
might be required; and, if they were poor, she made collections
for them, among those who were in a condition to give,
or informed the deacons of the case. She was obeyed as a
mother in Israel, and a true handmaid of the Lord."</p></blockquote>

<p>With the exception of "keeping the little children
in much awe," which might or might not have been
desirable, these are precisely the functions which I
desire to see formally renewed. The church at
Blooming Grove, Orange County, N.Y., has existed,
for more than a hundred years, without a creed, and
is governed by seven deacons and seven deacon<em>esses</em>.</p>

<p>The following resolution was introduced by the
Rev. S.J. May, at the Unitarian Conference which
met at Syracuse, N.Y., in the first week of October
1866:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Whereas women were among the first, the most steadfast,
and the most fearless disciples of Jesus Christ; whereas
women have been, in all ages, the most ready to embrace the
religion of the gospel, and the most constant and devoted
members of the Christian Church; and whereas, in several
denominations, women have been among the most effective
preachers of Christianity: therefore, <em>Resolved</em>, That we, Liberal
Christians, should do well to encourage those women among
us who are moved by the Holy Spirit to devote themselves to
the ministry, and should assist them to prepare themselves in
the same manner, and to the same extent, as we deem necessary
for young men."</p></blockquote>

<p>The convention, having just passed a resolution to
admit female delegates to the session of 1868, rather
shrank from this second vote. Yet of what use to
receive delegates, unless they feel free to join in discussion?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
and what woman, likely to be sent as a delegate
by any Unitarian church, will ever address the
convention until it <em>more</em> than welcomes the above
resolution? To the local conferences, women are
already being elected, and will do great good if they
can get courage to accept their membership practically,
and to speak when they have any thing to say.</p>

<p>It would not be quite honest nor fair to those women
who seek to enter the pulpit, if I did not here
record my own experience in connection with it.</p>

<p>I know very well where my natural sphere of work
lay, and could I have had a theological education in
my youth, or had even the paths of the ministry at
large been open to women, I have every reason to believe
that I should be at this moment a settled minister.
As it was, it never entered my head that the thing
was possible; and except that I taught steadily in Sabbath
schools, and visited as steadily among the city
poor, I never turned toward ministerial work. In the
first year of my marriage, now twenty-two years ago,
my husband was settled in the city of Baltimore, as
minister at large to the degraded population, which
has a special character (or want of character) in a large
city, in a slaveholding State. I say <em>has</em>, for I cannot yet
speak in the past tense. He had daily schools of girls
and women, and nightly schools of boys and men.
The latter were of all ages from six to forty, and had
been gathered together by a great personal effort. In
this state of things, my husband was taken ill. It fell
to me, in the first place, not only to nurse him, but to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
take charge of his night-school. The ladies could do
very well without me in the day-school; but there was
no clergyman, nor leading man of character and culture,
who could be depended upon to take the <em>general</em>
charge of the men and boys, among whom were some
desperate characters. I went first in a very stormy
night; and my Irish servant took her knitting, and sat
upon the steps of the platform while I addressed them.
It happened that not a single teacher braved the storm;
and the school, when I called the roll, responded to the
number of eighty. I told them that I knew how dearly
they loved my husband, that he was very ill, and that
the only way in which they could help him was to behave
so well that he need feel no anxiety about his
work. They responded at once to this appeal, and I
carried home the best possible account. As Sunday
drew near,&mdash;this night-school having been held on
Monday,&mdash;my husband grew more ill and more anxious.
He thought of the large, mixed congregation,
which met him every week, and for which no provision
had been made. We were on an outpost of our faith;
we could not have summoned assistance in season, nor
without an expense we could not well bear. I thought
the matter over; said to myself that it was only like a
large Sunday school; that the fashionable ladies, who
often dropped in to hear the preaching, would certainly
stay away, knowing my husband to be ill: so I told
him quietly that I had made arrangements for the Sunday
service. He was too weak to make inquiries, but
was comforted at once. He was sick several weeks,&mdash;long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
enough for me to relinquish reading, and take to
exhortation in pure despair; but he did not find a
small congregation when he resumed his place, and
that was my reward. Perhaps no such step was ever
taken more simply, or with less idea of its natural
consequences. When I came back to Boston, radical
country ministers took pains to ask me to their pulpits.
I shall not soon forget the first time I preached to a
large Unitarian audience, with a good mixture of city
people. It was at South Hingham; the church was
crowded; the country covered with a crystalline mantle
of snow, over which a clear moon glimmered. The
beauty of that night is a permanent possession. So
it went on, till I became, I believe in the winter of 1859
and 1860, the superintendent of the Sunday school at
Indiana-place Chapel, in Boston, where I remained for
five years. This broke up my preaching, for I could
not leave town on Sundays; but it led to my addressing
various Sunday-school gatherings, and my being
asked to address Sunday schools when away from home
in the summer. My addressing a Sunday school in
Greenfield in the summer of 1865, while the pastor
of the church was absent with his regiment, led, by his
kind sympathy, to my preaching in the summer of 1866
in the regular Unitarian churches at Rowe and Warwick,
as well as doing irregular service in many other
places. The church at Florence had always shown
me a generous appreciation; and I was often asked
to preach for Theodore Parker's people at the Music
Hall and the Melodeon. I always declined to speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
for this last society, not because I do not sympathize
with their purposes in the main, but because
I would not consent to be advertised for a religious
and especially a devotional service in the city which
I make my home. There may be women who, in
the present state of things, can do this innocently and
properly; but <em>I</em> cannot go into the pulpit myself,
except in the regular sequence of my work, and at
the call of duty. The gaping crowd of curious people
who would come to look at a woman in the pulpit,
would disturb the sphere in which it is alone possible
for me to work. It was the custom of the Music-Hall
society to advertise for every Sunday, and they declined
to relinquish this advertisement on my account.
The delivering a course of lectures in Hollis-street
Vestry in connection with the Suffolk Sunday-school
Union, in April, 1866, showed me that there was a
work of criticism to be done,&mdash;and necessary to be
done,&mdash;which I could do: so in going West to examine
the condition of certain colleges, in October, 1866, I
gave it to be understood, that, if I were in any
Western city over Sunday, I should prefer to preach for
the Unitarian minister&mdash;giving him a "labor of love"&mdash;to
addressing an audience at an evening lecture.
This interfered with my pecuniary advantage; but I
believed it was in my power to enter some pulpits
that would not be offered to all women, and I desired
to do what I could to create a demand for the preaching
of women. In this way, I preached for Robert
Collyer in Chicago, for Carlton Staples in Milwaukee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
for Mr. Hunting in Quincy, and in the chapels of
Oberlin and Antioch Colleges. I took the whole
service, accepting no assistance in the reading or the
prayer; for it is not well that a woman who fills the
pulpit should seem to shrink from any service there,
and sensitive women will always find their self-possession
impaired by any second influence. I received
the kindest sympathy and appreciation from the
churches I have mentioned; and, in every instance
but one, I received the usual fee for my service, voluntarily
tendered. I think at least twenty other
churches would have been open to me, could I have
gone to them.</p>

<p>I do not offer this explanation of the manner in
which I have been led into the pulpit, stupidly, in
ignorance of the charge of egotism and folly that may
be made against me by those who read it. I have
borne harder things than that charge, for the truth's
sake; and I hope that the real motive of this statement
will be transparent to honest and gentle hearts.</p>

<p>I long to see women preparing for this work, for
there are very few men in the field; and, if there were
more than enough, the pulpit is still an eminently fit
place for a woman. The encouragement I have received,
will show young women what is open to
them. With a few words of counsel to those who
may desire to speak in churches, I leave the subject.
The dress of a woman in the pulpit should be such
as will attract absolutely no attention; yet it should
be thoroughly graceful and lady-like. A black silk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
well made, with collar and cuffs of fine linen, is the
best, with no ornament whatever save the needful
brooch. Peculiarity should be avoided. When we
are trying to win souls for heaven, we must not lose
them, because of a "dress reform," which may wait
patiently, until more important things are achieved.</p>

<p>Again, if the woman who enters the pulpit is
a temperance, an antislavery, or a woman's-rights
lecturer, it will be better for her to give lectures on
these subjects in the week. In the pulpit, she should
subordinate these subjects to theological reform, moral
appeal, and that attempt to stimulate religious interest
and faith in which most men fail. Nor would I
have her, whatever her station in society, refuse the
fee, small or large, which shall be tendered her. If she
has no need of it, her "poor" will have; and it is important
to let the ministry of women fall into the same
social and congregational relations as that of men.</p>

<p>There has been a great change in public feeling
since the day, not twelve years since, when I heard
Dr. Parkman refuse Lucretia Mott permission to
speak in the old Federal-street Church.</p>

<p>Among historical instances of the theological influence
of woman, that of the Countess Matilda stands
pre-eminent; but a book by Capefigue, recently published
at Paris, shows, that Madame de Krudener was
the first to conceive the idea of the Holy Alliance,
and her influence over the Emperor Alexander was
sufficient to induce him to propose what his allies had
no power to decline. Her purpose was finally accomplished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
by her engaging the emperor in prayer. She
was finally exiled, and died, I believe, in the Crimea.
It was pretended that her preaching was dangerous;
but, as she spoke only in French, that could hardly be
true.</p>


<h5>ART SCHOOLS.</h5>

<p>An art school, which started some years ago in
Boston, in private hands, finally surrendered its casts,
lithographs, and so forth, to the teachers of the Free
Art School of the Lowell Institute. The female
classes of this school are always crowded, and are
doing a great deal of good. Artists are accustomed
to say very disparaging things of the school at the
Cooper Institute; but I visited it in December, 1866,
and found a very great improvement within a few
years. Under Dr. Rimmer, a most admirable lecturer
on anatomy, there has been an infusion of new life.
The drawings from casts looked better than I have
ever seen them. They have a good master in color,
and the drawing and engraving on wood by the
pupils find a ready market. Two of them, Miss
Roundtree and Miss Curtis, are said to have a high
reputation. I was delighted to find a large class
coloring photographs; for heretofore it has been
almost impossible for women to receive decent instruction
in this art. The classes are all full; and
three times the number of pupils might be received,
if there were more light in the large rooms. It is
to be hoped Mr. Cooper may some time divide them,
and put in gas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span></p>

<p>I have taken advantage of the residence in this
country of a well-known member of the Royal Academy,
Mrs. Elizabeth Murray, to ascertain what circumstances
led to the formation of the Society of
Female Artists, in London. To Mrs. Grote, the wife
of the historian, and Mrs. Murray herself, this society
owed its existence, somewhere in the winter of 1854
and 1855. There is no objection to it, so far as I
know, except one apparent on its catalogues, the
present preponderance of distinguished amateur artists
on the Board of Direction. I insert here Mrs.
Murray's letter in reply to my inquiries. The best
artists, such as Rosa Bonheur and Mrs. Murray herself,
exhibit with this society.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Dall</span>,&mdash;On my return to England, after
an absence of many years, I found that women labored under
very disheartening conditions; their professional occupations
consisting chiefly of teaching, music and singing, literature and
the fine arts. In the latter department, they came more under
my own personal observation; and I found, that, although
they were countenanced by men individually, collectively they
were persecuted by men, seldom being permitted membership
with any public body, or, when admitted, were not allowed
the full privileges accorded to men.</p>

<p>For instance: At the Royal Academy of London, women
are not admitted at all to membership. On the walls of that
exhibition may be seen the works of women, which rank
among the best; but here their privilege ends. They assist
in bringing their quota of the entrance fees, the main source
of income of the academy, while they are debarred from all
privileges and emoluments.</p>

<p>The two water-color societies profess to admit women as</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>members, which they do to a very limited extent; but even
here they are subject to the same restrictions. Under these
circumstances, the project occurred to me of founding a separate
and independent society, which should include only the
works of female artists, in order to give to those excluded from
other societies, opportunities of asserting their own powers.</p>

<p>The first step was to get up an exhibition to excite public
sympathy in favor of the scheme. This was a most difficult
undertaking, as opposition was met with, not only from
men, but from the very women whose interests were at
stake; those who were strong in the profession fearing to
lose caste, and the weaker ones being afraid to act independently.</p>

<p>After much perseverance and explanation, several large-minded
persons of the more moneyed and influential ranks in
society came forward, and assisted, by their cordial co-operation,
in establishing a temporary committee. Money was
freely contributed; and the society had a fair start, opening
to the public a very creditable exhibition of the works of
female artists.</p>

<p>Finding that, for the future, I must necessarily be absent
from England, I retired from the Committee of Direction.</p>

<p>The society has continued in a more or less prosperous
condition up to the present time, although my plan of establishing
an adequate school of art has not been carried out.
Much private good has been the result; and I think the class
of women for whom the society was founded, have been raised
in position. <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Believe me, dear madam,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Very truly yours,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">(Signed) <span class="smcap">Elizabeth Murray</span>.</span><br />
13, Pemberton Square, Dec. 22, 1866.</p></blockquote>

<p>In Paris, Rosa Bonheur is now the directress, under
the government, of the École Impériale de Dessein,
established exclusively for young women.</p>

<h5>LABOR.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></h5>

<p>The advance of women, as regards all sorts of labor,
in the United States, has been such as might be expected
by watchful eyes; and yet reports on the
general question will not read very differently from
those published ten years ago. In New York, women
are still reported as making shirts at seventy-five cents
a dozen, and overalls at fifty cents. These women
have two Protective Unions of their own, not connected
with the Workingmen's Union; and most of
them have, naturally enough, sympathized with the
eight-hour movement, not foreseeing, apparently, that
the necessary first result of that movement would be a
decrease of wages, proportioned to the limitation of
time. Ever since the beginning of the war, women
have been employed in the public departments, North
and South. It has been a matter of necessity, rather
than of choice. The same causes combined to drive
women into field-labor and printing-offices. All
through Minnesota and the surrounding regions,
women voluntarily assumed the whole charge of the
farms, in order to send their husbands to the field.
A very interesting account has been recently published
of a farm in Dongola, Ill., consisting of two
thousand acres, managed by a highly educated woman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
whose husband was a cavalry officer. It was a great
pecuniary success. In New Hampshire, last summer,
I was shown open-air graperies, wholly managed by
women, in several different localities; and was very
happy to be told that my own influence had largely
contributed to the experiment. In England, field-labor
is now recommended to women by Lord Houghton,
better known as Mr. Monckton Milnes, who considers
it a healthful resource against the terrible abuses of
factory life. At a meeting of the British Association,
last fall, he produced a well-written letter from a
woman engaged in brick-making. This letter claimed
that brick-making paid three times better than factory
labor, and ten times better than domestic service. In
addition to persons heretofore mentioned, in this country,
as employing women in out-door work, I would
name Mr. Knox, the great fruit-grower, who, on his
place near Pittsburg, Pa., employs two or three hundred.
I have seen it stated, that, during the last four
years, twenty thousand women have entered printing-offices.
I do not know the basis of this calculation;
but, judging from my local statistics, I should think it
must be nearly correct.</p>

<p>To the Committee of the Massachusetts Legislature
on the eight-hour movement, the following towns
report concerning the wages and labor of women, in
1866:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Boston.</span>&mdash;Glass Company, wages from $4.00 to $8.00 a
week. Domestics, from $1.50 to $3.00 per week. Seamstresses,
$1.00 a day. Makers of fancy goods, 40 to 50 cents
a day.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Brookline.</span>&mdash;Washerwomen, $1.00 a day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlestown</span> and <span class="smcap">New Bedford</span> are ashamed to name
the wages, but humbly confess that they are very low.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chicopee</span> pays women 90 per cent the wages of men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Concord</span> pays from 8 to 10 cents an hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fairhaven</span> gives to female photographers one-third the
wages of men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hadley</span> pays three-fourths; to domestics, one-third; seamstresses,
one-quarter to one-third.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Holyoke</span>, in its paper-mills, offers one-third to one-half.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lancaster</span> pays for pocket-book making from 50 to 75
cents a day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lee</span> pays in the paper-mills one-half the wages of men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lowell.</span>&mdash;The Manufacturing Company averages 90
cents a day. The Baldwin Mills pay 60 to 75 cents a day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Newton</span> pays its washerwomen 75 cents a day, or 10
cents an hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">North Becket</span> pays to women one-third the wages of
men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Northampton</span> pays $5.00 a week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Salisbury</span>, for sewing hats, $1.00 a day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">South Reading</span>, on rattan and shoe work, $5.00 to
$10.00 a week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">South Yarmouth</span>, half the wages of men, or less.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Taunton</span>, one-third to two-thirds the wages of men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walpole</span> pays two-thirds the wages of men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wareham</span> pays to its domestics from 18 to 30 cents a
day; to seamstresses, 50 cents to $1.00.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wilmington</span> pays two-thirds the wages of men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Winchester</span> pays dressmakers $1.00 a day; washerwomen,
12 cents an hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woburn</span> keeps its women to work from 11 to 13 hours,
and pays them two-thirds the wages of men.</p>

<p>On the better side of the question, <span class="smcap">Fall River</span> testifies
that women, in competition, earn nearly as much as men.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Lawrence</span>, from the Pacific Mills, that the women are
<em>liberally</em> paid. We should like to see the figures. The
Washington Mills pay from $1.00 to $2.00 a day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stoneham</span> gives them $1.50 per week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Waltham</span> reports the wages of the watch-factory as very
<em>remunerative</em>. In 1860, I reported this factory as paying from
$2.50 to $4.00 a week. Here, also, we should prefer figures
to a general statement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boston</span> has now many manufactories of paper collars.
Each girl is expected to turn out 1,800 daily. The wages
are $7.00 a week. In the paper-box factory, more than 200
girls are employed; but I cannot ascertain their wages, and
therefore suppose them to be low. I know individuals who
earn here $6.00 a week; but that must be <em>above</em> the average.</p></blockquote>

<p>The best-looking body of factory operatives that I
have ever seen are those employed in the silk and ribbon
mills on Boston Neck, lately under the charge of
Mr. J.H. Stephenson, and those at the Florence Silk
Mills in Northampton, owned by Mr. S.L. Hill. The
classes, libraries, and privileges appertaining to these
mills make them the best examples I know; and this
is shown in the faces and bearing of the women.</p>

<p>We are always referred to political economy, when
we speak of the low wages of women; but a little
investigation will show that other causes co-operate
with those, which can be but gradually reached, to
determine their rates.</p>

<blockquote><p>1. The wilfulness of women themselves, which,
when I see them in positions I have helped to open
to them, fills me with shame and indignation.</p>

<p>2. The unfair competition, proceeding from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
voluntary labor, in mechanical ways, of women well
to do.</p></blockquote>

<p>For the first, we cannot greatly blame the women
whom employers choose for their <em>good looks</em>, for
expecting to earn their wages through them, rather
than by the proper discharge of their duties. Their
conduct is not the less shameful on that account; but
I seem to see that only time and death and ruin will
educate them.</p>

<p>For the second, we must strive to develop a public
sentiment, which, while it continues to hold labor
honorable, will stamp with ignominy any women
who, in comfortable country homes, compete with the
workwomen of great cities. There are thousands of
wealthy farmers' wives to-day, who just as much
drive other women to sin and death as if they led
them with their own hands to the houses in which
they are ultimately compelled to take refuge. Still
further, it has come to be known to me, that in Boston,
and I am told in New York also, wealthy women,
who do not even do their own sewing, have the control
of the finer kinds of fancy work, dealing with the
stores which sell such work, under various disguises.
I cannot prove these words, but they will strike conviction
to the hearts of the women themselves, and I
wish them to have some significance for men; for, if
these women had the pocket-money which their taste
and position require, they would never dream of such
competition. One thing these men should know, that
such women are generally known to their employers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
and their domestic relations are judged accordingly.</p>

<p>The recent investigations into factory labor in England
concern rather the condition than the wages of
the women. At <em>flower-making</em>, 11,000 girls are employed
from fourteen to eighteen hours daily. In
<em>hardware</em> shops and factories, they work, from six
years of age, fourteen hours daily. In <em>glass</em> factories,
5,000 women are employed, from nine years of age
and upwards, eighteen hours daily. In <em>tobacco</em> factories,
7,000 women are employed, under conditions
of great physical suffering. As <em>knitters</em>, from six
years old, they work fourteen hours daily for 1s. 3d.
a week!</p>

<p>This terrible state of things is partly owing to competition
with the labor of French machinery. A great
deal of ignorant prejudice against machines is one of
its results. In Sheffield, <em>files</em> are still made by <em>hand</em>;
while here, in America, we make <em>watches</em> by <em>machinery</em>!
The disposition of the whole community,
both here and in Great Britain, towards this labor
question, is kindly. It has become a momentous
social problem. During the fifteen years that my
attention has been riveted to this subject, I have seen
a great change in public feeling.</p>

<p>I have received the Sixth Annual Report of the
Society for the Employment of Women, of which
the Earl of Shaftesbury is President, and Mr. Gladstone
a Vice-President. This society has trained
some hair-dressers, clerks, glass-engravers, book-keepers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
and telegraph operators; but its greatest service
consists in the constant issue of tracts, to influence
developing public opinion. Such an association
should be started in New York.</p>

<p>I should have been glad to inaugurate in Boston,
during the last six years, several important industrial
movements. The war checked the enthusiasm I had
succeeded in rousing; and I have not been able to
pause in my special work of collecting and observing
facts to stimulate it afresh, or to solicit personally the
necessary means. How easy it would be for a few
wealthy women to test these experiments!</p>

<p>I would first establish a mending-school; and, having
taught women how to darn and patch in a proper
manner, I would scatter them through the country, to
open shops of their own. As it is, I do not know a
city, in which a place exists to which a housekeeper
could send a week's wash, sure that it would be returned
with every button-hole, button, hem, gusset,
and stay in proper condition. These mending-shops
should take on apprentices, who should be sent to the
house to do every sort of repairing with a needle.</p>

<p>I would open another school to train women to every
kind of trivial service, now clumsily or inadequately
performed by men. If, for instance, you now send to
an upholsterer to have an old window-blind or blind-fixture
repaired, his apprentice will replace the entire
thing at a proportionate cost, leaving the old screw-holes
to gape at the gazer. I would train women to
wash, repair, and replace in part, and to carry in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
pockets little vials of white or red lead to fill the gaping
holes. Full employment could be found for such
apprentices.</p>

<p>At Milwaukee, in October, 1866, I found a young
woman well established as a hair-dresser. She belonged
to a superior class of society, and encountered
great opposition in carrying out her plan. "People
would treat her much better," said a resident clergyman
to me, in detailing her struggles, "if she were the
willing mistress of a rich man." She had no taste for
teaching, but I found in her a cultivated and pleasant
companion. Since the war began, a good many
women have been employed as clerks in the public
offices at Washington. There is now some talk of
their removal. If this should occur, it would be in consequence
of unfit appointments, and the habits and
annoyances which demoralized women have imposed
upon the departments. The proper place to begin
removals is obviously with the corrupt men, who
have pensioned their mistresses out of the public
coffers.</p>

<p>In Chicago, I found Fanny Paine, a girl of thirteen,
acting as paymaster to the Eagle Works Manufacturing
Company. She will, in one year, pay out a
quarter of a million of dollars. She keeps the time-sheets,
pay-roll, and account-book of each of the four
hundred men employed. She receives about five
thousand dollars a week from the bank, and makes
the proper balances with the cashier, after paying her
men. She knows every man, earns six hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
twenty-five dollars per annum, and is represented as
perfectly robust. It gave me no pleasure to find so
young a girl in a position so exposed. I would have
her uncommon faculties mature in quiet. The "London
Athenæum" lately said, "A phenomenon worthy
of consideration is the increasing number of female
players on stringed instruments in France. At the
examination of the conservatory this year, Mademoiselle
Boulay gained a first, Mademoiselle Castellan a
second prize. The violoncello has its professional
students among the gentler sex. Madame Viardot is
about to turn her experience to account, by editing a
classical selection of music."</p>

<p>A very dear friend of mine,&mdash;Charlotte Hill, of
West Gouldsborough, in Maine,&mdash;born a farmer's
daughter, too deaf to teach, and too delicate to sew,
had an intense love for music. She taught herself
the violin. She then made a profession for herself by
offering to play it at rustic parties; and one year, in
the pursuit of this profession, she travelled more than
eight hundred miles, and laid by three hundred dollars.
This money was not spent on jewelry, but on
the best books that our best publishers could furnish.
It takes a genius to do a thing like that,&mdash;trust in
one's self, and a far deeper trust in God; but there are
multitudes of women whom suggestion and sympathy
would lead into such thriving ways.</p>

<p>I have heard recently of a young girl in Shirley,
who supports herself and her father by gunning. She
not only sends game to market, but prepares the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
breasts of birds for ornamental purposes. She has
bought her own house by her profits.</p>

<p>When I was at Florence, Mass., in the summer of
1865, I drove over to the famous button-factory at
Easthampton. This great industry was founded by
a woman; and, as I had often heard mythical stories
about it, I wished to get at the facts. I found Samuel
Williston, a very good specimen of a fine old
English gentleman. He is a man between sixty and
seventy, with hair and beard as white as snow. I
found him in a blue coat with bright buttons, a
buff waistcoat, and white pants, and very willing to
tell his wife's story, if it would "encourage other
women."</p>

<p>"My wife's father," he went on to say, "was a Mr.
Graves. He was a poor man, with a large family of
children. His wife and daughters used to go over to
Northampton to get knitting from the stores. One
day, all the knitting had been given out; and Mrs.
Graves showed her disappointment so plainly that the
shopman asked her to take some buttons to cover.
In those days, all our buttons came from England,
where they were made by hand; but our tailor had
got out, and wanted some for coats and vests in a
hurry. Mrs. Graves made about a gross, all her
daughters helping, and did it so well that the work
was continued. Then my wife took it up. She got
some of the work from her mother. That was in
1825-26,&mdash;forty years ago. I had invested in merino
sheep. I had ninety ewes and a large farm; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
was a young man, and found it hard to get along.
It looked as though this business would help. My
wife wanted to control the work. She hired girls to
help her, and took all the orders that came. J.D.
Whitney and Hayden &amp; Whitney sold all she could
make. When she had had the business a year, I went
to Boston, Providence, Hartford, New Haven, New
York,&mdash;in short, I went <em>all round</em>,&mdash;with samples.
I got my orders at first hand, and from that the business
began.</p>

<p>"When we heard that machine-made buttons had
been introduced into England, we sent over to buy the
right to make them, and Mr. Hayden introduced them
here.</p>

<p>"Every man must have his small beginnings," added
Mr. Williston, with an embarrassed blush; "but, when
a man has such a wife as mine, he is lucky."</p>

<p>It is said that nearly a million of dollars is invested
in this button business at Easthampton. The Willistons
are Congregational Christians; and the "Round
Table" stated lately, that the wealth thus accumulated,
besides being of great local value in developing
the resources of the State, had established one seminary,
built three churches, and assisted colleges and
schools without number.</p>

<p>It is very rare that the labor of women becomes
consolidated into capital; but there is no reason why
it should not. The mother of James Freeman Clarke,
whose name I use here in compliance with her own
expressed desire, was a wonderful illustration of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
common sense and determination will accomplish.
The petted darling of a wealthy family, Madame
Clarke found herself summoned, by her husband's illness
and early death, to retrieve, almost unaided, the
fortunes of six children. The first money which she
could lay aside, at the head of a boarding-house, lifted
the mortgage from a small property which she knew
she was to inherit, and which she felt sure would increase
in value. For this property she ultimately received
her own price, being, to the great amazement
of applicants, her own "man of business" in all negotiations.
The small sum it yielded she put out at
interest in new States, where money was scarce, and
multiplied it tenfold before she died, not by careless
speculation, but by investing it wisely in the heart of
the great cities of Chicago and Milwaukee, by buying
what she saw with her own eyes to be valuable. "I
want women to know how to manage their own concerns
as I did," she would say. "It only takes a little
common sense. Women ought not to give up their
property to men, or even ask their advice about it.
The best men will prop up their shaky plans with a
woman's money; but women should watch men, see
where shrewd men put their money, and do as they
<em>do</em>, not as they <em>say</em>."</p>

<p>I am sorry that the purpose of this volume does
not permit me to show how this noble woman used
the money she made for the profit, the religious advancement,
and the bodily comfort of those who
seemed to need its aid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span></p>

<p>One other woman, whose name I am not permitted
to mention, deserves to be spoken of in this connection.
She was an orphan, and began life as a factory
girl with twelve cents and a half. Her father had
never dreamed of any need to educate a daughter.
She took a sister into the factory with her; and, while
one worked, the other went to school,&mdash;my friend
opening a dressmaker's shop, at times, to speed the
process. While in the mills, she secured, by a wise
firmness, many privileges for the girls. She married,
and, after the death of an only child, sought to make
herself happy, by being of use; and opened, for the
girls whose wages had been reduced, a Protective
Union shoe-store, taking all that one man and eight
apprentices could make daily. At last, she borrowed
a hundred dollars, and went to Lynn,&mdash;the first
woman that ever bought goods there. She soon controlled
the prices of the trade, opened a second store,
and finally bought out the Union.</p>

<p>Part of her store she devoted to fancy goods, and,
for seven years and a half, did all the buying in Boston.
She then went to Philadelphia, leaving the
stores in her husband's charge, and took her degree at
Pennsylvania College. After this, she lectured on
Physiology throughout New England, being often
profitably employed by the corporations to lecture to
the girls. By this time, she owned her horse and carriage,
her house, and twenty thousand dollars, beside
having a good practice in a country town. Circumstances
then carried her to California, where, in three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
years and a half, she made thirteen thousand dollars,
partly by her profession, and partly by buying up
Government vouchers, in which the men at the Navy
Yard were paid. She gave gold, and received greenbacks.
Before she left the State, one of its most
eminent physicians came to her to know by what
secret she cured patients whom he had given up.
She showed him the errors of his own practice;
and, when she returned to New England, left, with
perfect faith, her patients in his hands.</p>

<p>If this woman were not still living, I should wish
to record the details of her life; but they suggest so
much, that I have not thought it right to suppress
them altogether.</p>

<p>Mr. Thayer and two ladies have lately attempted,
in Boston, at No. 28, Ash Street, a small experiment
in the way of a lodging-house for girls. This was
first suggested to the ladies, by the misfortunes of a
young woman who came under their notice. They
tried to hire a house, but found it cheaper to buy;
Mr. Thayer being responsible for half the expense,
and each of the ladies for one-quarter. The house
was furnished at the cost of friends. It has gas and
water in nearly every room, and shelters 29 girls.
They pay for light, rent, lodging, and fire, repairs and
service, $1.50 per week, and $1.25. There are two
single beds in most of the rooms. The matron keeps
an exact account of her expenditure; and each week
the stores are weighed by one of the ladies, the waste
being charged, as well as the marketing, to the girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span></p>

<p>The board, so managed, costs each girl $1.75 a week.
Some of the girls wash for themselves in the evening,
and a woman is hired for the house once a week.
They take care of their own rooms. The matron
employs a cook. There are only two rules,&mdash;that
every girl shall be in at 10 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and that a week's
notice shall be given when any inmate desires to
leave. No supervision is exercised except of the
stores and the matron's accounts. The house was
opened Dec. 15, 1866, and is a success according to
its plan.</p>

<p>Grateful as I am to see this attempt made, I cannot
feel that this plan should be followed for the future.
Girls do not wish to receive charity, nor can
any experiment be thoroughly successful, which does
not pay, in the long-run, a fair percentage on the cost
of house and furniture. Now, $4.00 a week is, in my
estimation, only the fair cost price of the style of
board and living which these girls receive; and it
could not be kept at that under average management.</p>

<p>I do not know the cost of the house, but it would
certainly rent for $600. The taxes upon it would be,
at least, $120.</p>

<p>Now, let us suppose that 30 girls occupy it, each
paying the highest rent, of $1.50 per week, which is
$45 a month. In 13 months, they would pay $585;&mdash;a
sum less than the rent alone; the house and
water taxes, light, lodging, fire, repairs, and service,
being thrown in gratis. I am sure my estimate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
the rent and taxes is beneath the real value of both;
and it is evident, that no efforts to benefit this class,
on a large scale, will succeed, unless made to pay
better: companies will undertake only profitable
work. I want to see girls unite to furnish themselves,
in a still more modest way, with what they
need; and I wish to see a system of cooking-houses
established, which shall simplify the whole matter.</p>

<p>In New York, a Working-women's Home is about
to be established, the plan of which was long since
submitted to the public. A building has been purchased
on Elizabeth Street, which will afford accommodations
for four hundred persons. For this,
$100,000 has been paid, and $25,000 more will be
expended in fitting it up. Half the amount has
already been raised; and the managers are making
strong efforts to collect the remainder. Of its objects,
the "Evening Post" says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"In this Home will be found clean, well-ventilated rooms,
wholesome food, and facilities for education and self-improvement.
Girls exposed to the temptations of a city life will be
surrounded by both moral and Christian influences.</p>

<p>"The institution is intended to benefit a class of women
who now find it impossible, with their slender means, to procure
comfortable homes, and are forced to live where moral
purity, as well as health, is endangered.</p>

<p>"It is well known that families and boarding-house keepers
almost always object to female boarders, and that many
thousands of sewing-women find it difficult to obtain quarters.
Artificial flower-makers, book-folders, hoop-skirt manufacturers,
packers of confectionery, &amp;c., are compelled, if deprived</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>of parental shelter, to accept such homes and accommodations
as their very limited resources will command.</p>

<p>"It is not intended to make this a charitable institution;
but the prices will be made so moderate as to be within the
means of those who are to be benefited by it, while, at the
same time, the establishment will be self-sustaining."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Halliday says of it,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The whole expense of first purchase, alterations, and
furniture, will be about $140,000. Messrs. Peter Cooper,
James Lenox, James Brown, Stewart Brown, William H.
Aspinwall, E.J. Woolsey, and Mrs. C.L. Spencer, have,
unsolicited, each contributed one thousand dollars. Twenty
thousand dollars has been appropriated on condition that we
obtained a like amount in donations. We expect to have
accommodations for nearly five hundred, and the charge for
board and washing will be from three dollars and a quarter
to three and a half per week.</p>

<p>"There will be parlors, reading room and free library, and
ample bathing rooms. None of good reputation will be refused
admission; no others can become members of the
family."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is hoped to open the institution by the first of
June.</p>

<p>A Young Women's Christian Association was organized
in Boston in May, 1866, under the auspices of
Mrs. Henry F. Durant. Furnished rooms have been
provided at 27, Chauncy Street, where young women
can obtain information in regard to employment,
boarding-houses, and so on. The applications average
one hundred a month; and the association seeks
to establish a home, where there will be a restaurant
for furnishing meals, at cost, to <em>young women only</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
a free reading and library room, evening schools,
rooms for social purposes, and temporary lodging-rooms.
This is a most desirable thing to do; but it
will not be of permanent benefit, if it puts into a
false position any girls capable of self-support. The
funds of wise and kind people must start all such
movements; but, to be useful, they must be, not only
in appearance, but in reality, self-supporting.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1866, Octavia Hill, of London,
a grand-daughter of the celebrated Dr. Southwood
Smith, reports that, after conferring with John Ruskin,
she had hired houses for poor tenants. She put
them into good order, and kept them in it. She
would allow, in her tenants, neither overcrowding nor
arrears of rent. She had no middle-men. The experiment
was wholly successful, and paid at once five per
cent.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruskin's lodging-houses, as they are called, are
the best that have ever been established in London.
They furnish the cheapest and cleanest lodgings for
the poor, yet pay a good dividend. They are entirely
in the hands of Miss Hill, as Mr. Ruskin himself is
more skilful to remedy any social excrescence than
patient to bear with it. He forgets, I think, what he
once wrote concerning the soul that denies itself an
encounter with pain.</p>

<p>I have mentioned, in the body of this book, the
great number of women who have entered printing-offices
since 1860. I have thought that it might help
women in some other departments of labor, to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
how some of these changes were effected, and
in what manner advantages have been secured, which
might easily have been lost. In a town that I know
of, a weekly religious paper was printed by eight women.
The most experienced acted as foreman; and
when, in the second year of the war, strikes began in
the printing-offices, a friend directed her attention to
the fact, and showed her how to meet a strike should
it come, as it did, into her own town. As soon as she
heard of it, she consulted with the rest of the hands.
Seeing a possible though by no means a certain advantage,
they agreed to be bound by her action in
such an event. At last, the hands employed on the
daily evening paper of the town struck, and the publisher
knew not what to do. The girl went to him,
told him she would bring seven able hands with her,
and was accepted at once. He was mean enough to
offer half-pay, which she peremptorily refused. The
eight women entered the office on full pay. They had
not been there a week, before every body rejoiced in
the change. There was no swearing and no drinking,
but a quiet workroom. At the end of a month, the
disappointed men offered to return: their services
were declined, but the publisher was mean enough to
go to his foreman. "My men are ready to come
back," said he: "I have no fault to find with <em>you</em>, but
I can no longer give you full wages."&mdash;"Do as you
please," replied the girl: "you cannot have us for any
less;" and, as the whole seven said amen, the publisher
had nothing to do but to keep them. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
advantage that flowed from union and good sense in
this case are evident, and could easily be imitated
in many directions. During the past winter, Miss
Stebbens, of Chickasaw County, Iowa, has been appointed
notary public; such appointments being still
so rare as to make the fact worth recording.</p>


<h5>LAW.</h5>

<p>The "British Medical Journal" was lately reported
to have said that more English women seek for admission
to the bar than for entrance into medical practice.
If this be true, it is in marked contrast to the state of
things in this country. Some women have studied
law here; many have written in lawyers' offices; but,
so far as I know, not one has desired to be admitted
to the bar: and, in England itself, so far as I know,
Miss Shedden remains the single example of a woman
pleading in a court of law.</p>

<p>The number of laws passed the last six years, affecting
the condition of women, has been very small.</p>

<p>The New-York Assembly in February, 1865, passed
a law putting the legal evidence of a married woman
on the same basis as if she were a <em>feme sole</em>. The
Massachusetts Legislature have legalized marriage
ceremonies performed by an ordained woman; and in
January, 1866, Mr. Peckham, of Worcester, moved for
a joint special committee "to consider in what way a
more just and equal compensation shall be awarded
to female labor." On the 4th of April, just past,
Samuel E. Sewall and others petitioned for leave to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
appoint women on school committees. It is difficult
to conceive on what ground such petitioners had
leave to withdraw. These things are only valuable
as indicating that public attention is still alive.</p>

<p>In Richmond, Va., recently, a charge of stealing
was sustained against a woman, who was afterwards
acquitted, by appeal, on the ground that no married
woman could own her own clothing, and the consequent
flaw in the indictment. In consequence, a bill
to secure the rights of property to a married woman,
as if she were a <em>feme sole</em>, has been offered in the
House, to the horror of members who gravely assert
that there can be no marriages, if a man does not
own his wife's wardrobe!</p>

<p>In Missouri, the new Constitution confers on women
the right to make a will; and the Legislature is
considering the subject of introducing women to the
State University.</p>

<p>In England, a curious decision has recently been
made, in the case of a clergyman, of the Church of
England, who left his children to the guardianship
of his wife, without expressing any opinion as to their
religious education. Joint guardian with the wife
was a brother clergyman, who brings action to have it
decided by the Court where the children shall attend
church. The mother, and a son of thirteen, desire to
attend a dissenting chapel; but Sir J. Stuart, Vice-Chancellor,
decided that the <em>father's</em> religious faith
must decide the matter for the children! Such absurdity
will do more than any argument to secure the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
future freedom of woman. The family history of
Madame de Bedout, recently dead at Paris, furnishes,
also, a remarkable illustration of the absurdity of the
old laws.</p>

<p>The will of Francis Jackson, of Boston, has been recently
brought before our courts to obtain instructions
as to its construction. Mr. Jackson's bequest for the
purpose of creating an antislavery sentiment has been
sustained; but the decision reads, February, 1867:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The gift in the sixth article, to create a trust, unrestricted
in point of time, to secure the passage of laws granting to
women different rights from those belonging to them under
the existing Constitution and laws, does not constitute a legal
charity, and is therefore void, and is remitted to the testator's
heirs-at-law."</p></blockquote>

<p>The gift in question was intended to aid the publication
of such books as the reader now holds in his
hand.</p>

<p>A very important convention came together at
Leipsic, in September, 1865. One hundred and fifty
women assembled, pledged to assert the right to
labor, and to bridge the gulf between the compensations
of the two sexes. Madame Louise Otto Peters
opened the conference in an able speech. She stated
that there were five millions of women in Germany,
who could each earn, if allowed, three thalers a week.
A thousand women might find employment as chemists,
on salaries of one hundred and fifty thalers a year,
exclusive of board and lodging. Another thousand
might be employed as boot-closers. The foundation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
of industrial and commercial schools was urged. The
weak point of the speech, as reported, appeared to be,
that it took no cognizance of the fact, that an influx
of five millions of laborers must necessarily lower the
current rate of wages she proposed. I mention this
convention in a legal connection, believing that it was
intended to remove some local legal barriers.</p>

<p>A petition from sixty women of Potter County,
Penn., has just been presented to the Legislature of
that State, praying for the passage of an act to enable
widows, on the death of a husband, to control the
property acquired by joint labor, in the same manner
as the husband does on the death of the wife.</p>

<p>When Freeman Clarke was Comptroller of the
United-States Currency, he decided that a woman,
not being a <em>citizen</em>, could not be a bank director. I
consider this logical and satisfactory. I wish more
decisions of this kind could be made. If the position
that woman is not a citizen were pushed to its extreme,
it would become untenable, her property could
not be taxed, and the necessary remedy would be
applied. One bank remonstrated against the comptroller's
decision, desiring to retain the services of
women "hitherto satisfactory." I see, by a Washington
paper, that another national bank desires leave
to diminish the number of its directors; so many of
its shares being held by women, that nine men could
not be found to fill the office.</p>

<p>Now, let some bright women buy up, through a
broker, all the shares of such a bank, elect their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
president and directors, and see what the Government
can do. The absurdity of such a position, practically,
is evident to all who know how business is done in
our country towns.</p>


<h5>SUFFRAGE.</h5>

<p>Dr. Hunt and a few other women have continued
their annual protests, without intermission. In somewhat
the same way have petitions recently been sent
to Congress in behalf of universal suffrage. We had
no expectation that any favorable reception would
await such petitions; but it was a duty to put them
on record, if we could do it without perplexing public
business. What fate they met in Congress, you have
so recently heard, that I have no occasion to record it.
Minnesota, New York, and other States, have petitioned
their Legislatures to the same effect.</p>

<p>On the 7th of February, 1867, the House of Representatives
in Kansas decided, in concurrence with the
Senate, to amend a resolution for the amendment of
the Constitution, by striking out the words "white"
and "male," and making intelligence the basis of
suffrage after 1870. This action has been since rescinded
in some way, only the word "<em>white</em>" being
stricken out. In Congress, Mr. Noel, of Missouri,
offered a series of resolutions in favor of extending
suffrage to women, and authorizing the calling of a
convention to amend the Constitution in the State of
Missouri. The acting Vice-President, the Speaker
of the Senate, in recording his protest against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
Suffrage Bill of the District of Columbia, said, "Make
it <em>intelligent</em> suffrage, and I will not only vote for that,
but for <em>women</em> also."</p>

<p>At the recent election of officers for the Philadelphia
Mercantile Library, the female stockholders were
admitted to the ballot.</p>

<p>The "New-York Express" says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The exercise of the elective franchise for women was
practically illustrated in the election of officers for the Mercantile
Library, Philadelphia, on Tuesday. A poll was
opened for the female stockholders, who, to the number of
a hundred and fifty-six, cast their votes. Both sexes voted
together; and the proceedings were conducted with the utmost
propriety, there being no confusion or disorder, as is too often
the case where men vote alone. The ladies walked up, and
deposited their ballots with as much <em>sang froid</em> as if they
were accustomed to the privilege. As illustrating how the
thing <em>might be done</em>, this voting at the library election should
be noted."</p></blockquote>

<p>Some doubts having been expressed as to the fact
of women having voted in New Jersey, first published
by me, on information given by Thomas Garratt, in
my lectures upon Law, I append here a history of
the Constitution of New Jersey in that regard, which
has been gathered by Lucy Stone and Antoinette
Blackwell, as well as an account of my own recent
interview with a member of the House of 1807, which
finally repealed the obnoxious clause.</p>

<p>During the recent important discussion in the Senate
upon the proposition to extend the ballot to the
women of the District of Columbia, New Jersey was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
alluded to as a precedent. The precedent being
disputed, the following statement was published in
the "Newark Daily Advertiser:"&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"In 1709 a provincial law confined the privilege of voting
to 'male freeholders having one hundred acres of land
in their own right, or fifty pounds current money of the province
in real and personal estate;' and, during the whole
of the colonial period, these qualifications continued unchanged.</p>

<p>"But on the 2d of July, 1776 (two days before the
Declaration of Independence), the Provincial Congress of
New Jersey, at Burlington, adopted a Constitution, which
remained in force until 1844, of which sect. 4 is as follows:
'Qualifications of Electors for Members of Legislatures. <em>All
inhabitants of this colony</em>, of full age, who are worth fifty
pounds proclamation-money, clear estate in the same, and have
resided within the county in which they claim a vote for
twelve months immediately preceding the election, shall be
entitled to vote for representatives in Council and Assembly,
and also for all other public officers that shall be elected by
the people of the county at large.'</p>

<p>"Sect. 7 provides that the Council and Assembly jointly
shall elect <em>some fit person within the colony</em> to be Governor.
This Constitution remained in force until 1844.</p>

<p>"Thus, by a deliberate change of the terms 'male freeholder'
to 'all inhabitants,' suffrage and ability to hold the
highest office in the State were conferred both on women and
negroes.</p>

<p>"In 1790, a committee of the Legislature reported a bill
regulating elections, in which the words '<em>he or she</em>' are applied
to voters; thus giving legislative indorsement to the
alleged meaning of the Constitution.</p>

<p>"In 1797 the Legislature passed an act to regulate elections,
containing the following provisions:&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sect. 9. 'Every voter shall openly, and in full view, deliver
<em>his or her ballot</em>, which shall be a single written ticket,
containing the names of the person or persons for whom <em>he or
she votes</em>,' &amp;c.</p>

<p>"Sect. 11. 'All free inhabitants of full age, who are worth
fifty pounds proclamation-money, and have resided within the
county in which they claim a vote for twelve months immediately
preceding the election, shall be entitled to vote for all
public officers which shall be elected by virtue of this act; and
no person shall be entitled to vote in any other township or
precinct than that in which he or she doth actually reside at
the time of the election.'</p>

<p>"Mr. William A. Whitehead, of Newark, in a paper upon
this subject, read by him in 1858 before the New-Jersey Historical
Society, states that, in this same year (1797), women
voted, at an election in Elizabethtown, for members of the
Legislature. 'The candidates between whom the greatest
rivalry existed were John Condit and William Crane, the
heads of what were known, a year or two later, as the "Federal
Republican" and "Federal Aristocratic" parties, the former
the candidate of Newark and the northern portions of the
county, the latter that of Elizabethtown and the adjoining
country, for Council. Under the impression that the candidates
would poll nearly the same number of votes, the Elizabethtown
leaders thought, that, by a bold <i xml:lang="Fr">coup d'état</i>, they might secure
the success of Mr. Crane. At a late hour of the day, and, as
I have been informed, just before the close of the poll, a
number of females were brought up, and, under the provisions
of the existing laws, allowed to vote. But the man&oelig;uvre
was unsuccessful; the majority for Mr. Condit in the county
being ninety-three, notwithstanding.'</p>

<p>"The 'Newark Sentinel,' about the same time, states that
'no less than seventy-five women were polled at the late election
in a neighboring borough.' In the presidential election
of 1800, between Adams and Jefferson, 'females voted very</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>generally throughout the State; and such continued to be the
case until the passage of the act (1807) excluding them from
the polls. At first, the law had been so construed as to admit
single women only: but, as the practice extended, the construction
of the privilege became broader, and was made to
include females eighteen years old, married or single, and even
<em>women of color</em>; at a contested election in Hunterdon
County in 1802, the votes of two or three such actually electing
a member of the Legislature.</p>

<p>"That women voted at a very early period, we are informed
by the venerable Mr. Cyrus Jones, of East Orange, who was
born in 1770, and is now ninety-seven years old. He says
that 'old maids, widows, and unmarried women very frequently
voted, but married women very seldom;' that 'the
right was recognized, and very little said or thought about
it in any way.'</p>

<p>"In the spring of 1807, a special election was held in Essex
County, to decide upon the location of a court-house and jail;
Newark and its vicinity struggling to retain the county buildings,
Elizabethtown and its neighborhood striving to remove
them to 'Day's Hill.'</p>

<p>"The question excited intense interest, as the value of every
man's property was thought to be involved. Not only was
every legal voter, man or woman, white or black, brought out;
but, on both sides, gross frauds were practised. The property
qualification was generally disregarded; aliens, and boys and
girls not of full age, participated; and many of both sexes
'voted early, and voted often.' In Aquackanonk Township,
thought to contain about three hundred legal voters, over
eighteen hundred votes were polled, all but seven in the interest
of Newark.</p>

<p>"It does not appear that either <em>women or negroes</em> were
more especially implicated in these frauds than the white men.
But the affair caused great scandal, and they seem to have
been made the scapegoats.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>"When the Legislature assembled, they set aside the election
as fraudulent; yet Newark retained the buildings. Then
they passed an act (Nov. 15, 1807), restricting the suffrage to
white male adult citizens twenty-one years of age, residents in
the county for the twelve months preceding, and worth fifty
pounds proclamation-money. But they went on, and provided
that all such whose names appeared on the last duplicate of
State or county taxes should be considered worth fifty pounds;
thus virtually abolishing the property qualification.</p>

<p>"In 1820, the same provisions were repeated, and maintained
until 1844, when the present State Constitution was
substituted.</p>

<p>"Thus it appears, that, from 1776 to 1807,&mdash;a period of
thirty-one years,&mdash;the right of women and negroes to vote
was <em>admitted and exercised</em>; then from 1807 to 1844&mdash;by
an arbitrary act of the Legislature, which does not seem to
have been ever contested&mdash;the constitutional right was <em>suspended</em>,
and both women and negroes excluded from the polls
for thirty-seven years more. The extension of suffrage, in
the State Constitution of 1776, to 'all inhabitants' possessing
the prescribed qualifications, was doubtless due to the Quaker
influence, then strong in West Jersey, and then, as now, in
favor of the equal rights of women.</p>

<p>"Since 1844, under the present Constitution, suffrage is
conferred upon 'every white male citizen of the United States,
of the age of twenty-one years, who shall have been a resident
of this State one year, and of the county in which he
claims a vote five months next before the election,' excepting
paupers, idiots, insane persons, and criminals.</p>

<p>"This Constitution is subject to amendment by a majority
of both Houses of two successive Legislatures, when such
amendment is afterward ratified by the people at a special
election.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 12em;">"<span class="smcap">Lucy Stone</span>,</span><br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span></p>

<p>In a recent visit to Perth Amboy, a friend directed
my attention to a figure in a broad-brimmed hat, very
much like that which used to adorn the cover of
Poor Richard's Almanac. "That man is ninety-five
years old," said he. "He spent his youth in preventing
the New-Jersey people from running their slaves
off South. A prospective emancipation act had been
passed, which made the young negroes a poor investment;
but our friend Parker, there, looked after them
without any fee. We think he looks like Benjamin
Franklin." The next day, I took a drive with Mr.
Parker himself, and I found he possessed another
claim on my interest. The original Constitution of
New Jersey, adopted in 1776, left women free to vote,
by leaving out the word "male." In 1790, when the
Constitution was revised, a Quaker member, "Friend
Hooper," rose to say that among his people the women
were allowed their natural share of influence. At his
instance, the matter was made clearer by the insertion
of the words "he or she." In 1807, after an election
contested with singular virulence, these words were
expunged, and the word "male" inserted. I had
never expected to see a member of the Legislature
who repealed this phrase; but Friend Parker was
there, and helped do it. He assured me that the
women were not at that time anxious to retain the
privilege; but that, if they had been, the Legislature
was so irate, that the change would have taken place.
Lads, both white and colored, and under age, had
dressed in women's clothes, to swell the ballot, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
was more than double what it should have been; the
irritating question being the possible removal of
the county buildings.</p>

<p>A few days since, I cut from the paper the following
paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"In the Kentucky House of Representatives, on Friday
last, an address was received by the Speaker, from Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, of
New York, and read by the Clerk, asking the Legislature
of the Southern States to grant suffrage to white women in
the South, so as to give the Democratic party the advantage
over the negro votes, if Congress passes a general negro-suffrage
law. By following out this plan, Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; thinks
the South can govern the country, as in the days of Jefferson."</p></blockquote>

<p>I suppress the name, which was printed in full, in
this paragraph, because it is the name of a woman I
respect; and I earnestly hope the whole charge is false.
If women seek to advance their own cause by mean
and meretricious tricks,&mdash;such as those which have
dishonored the policy of men,&mdash;may God for ever
disappoint their hope! I would rather be defeated
with the friends of liberty than crowned with its foes.
It is because I believe woman strong enough to withstand
the low and loose and degrading temptations
of public life that I would lead her towards it. If
she cannot enter it as an inspiration, may she be for
ever shut out!</p>

<p>Mrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony, assisted by Lucy
Stone and Antoinette Blackwell, have been busy in
agitating all legal questions, and especially the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
of suffrage, ever since the formation of the Equal-Rights
Association, in New York, in May, 1866.
Wherever there is any prospect of a convention to
change a State Constitution, it would seem wise
to agitate the matter; but here, in Massachusetts,
almost every thing has been done that should be
to protect women, except to give them the right of
suffrage. That question we are too wise to agitate,
until the country recovers somewhat from the anxieties
and perplexities of the war. We have no
desire to win from an unjust judge, for our importunity's
sake, a right which could never be useful,
unless it were accorded with the hearty sympathy of
the best part of the community. On March 16, 1867,
a motion was made in the Massachusetts House to
instruct the Judiciary Committee to report an amendment
to the State Constitution, granting the right of
suffrage to women. The yeas and nays were taken,
and the motion was lost: yeas 44, nays 97.</p>

<p>In New York, Illinois, and Michigan, the question
is to be brought before the Constitutional Convention.
Wisconsin is our banner State, both branches
of her government having concurred, April 4, 1867,
in a resolution to submit it to the people. In New
York, last year, Mrs. Stanton proposed herself as
a candidate for Congress, and received, I think, thirty
votes. It was so well understood that her election
was impossible, that her card excited neither ridicule
nor discussion. No one cared to turn aside
from more pressing interests to consider it. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
therefore a waste of strength. I saw, with pain, that
some women did not shrink from employing last year
a politician's trick, and sent to Democratic members
of the Senate and House the petitions for the right
of suffrage for women, with which they knew them to
possess no sympathy. Had these petitions been sent
to Republican members of either House, they might
have been overlooked in the press of graver anxieties.
Mischievously sent to men like Cowan, women must
have known that the petition would be produced, if it
was only to annoy and perplex our honest friends of
the Republican party. In what would our influence
upon politics be better than that of men, if we resort
to such measures? During the past year, I drew
up, and forwarded to the Hon. Charles Sumner, a
petition for the right of suffrage, and afterwards sustained
it by two or three letters. I think Mr. Sumner
never brought it forward; but I gladly defer to his
judgment as to that. It was my duty to keep the
subject in mind, and see that we did not appear, even
in the tumult left by civil war, to lose sight of our
claim. I am glad to offer public thanks to the Hon.
George Thompson, who, in the meeting of the Equal-Rights
Association, held in Philadelphia on Jan. 17,
1867, defeated a resolution of thanks to Mr. Cowan,
and condemnation to Mr. Sumner, on precisely
these grounds. "To thank men like Cowan, who
did not <em>desire</em> to enfranchise woman any more than
the negro, was to stultify ourselves," he said. "To
condemn Sumner, because he did not think <em>this</em> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
time to push the claims of woman, was not honorable
to the long-tried friend of human progress."</p>

<p>Abroad, such things look better. The clean hands
of John Stuart Mill&mdash;which no noble woman need
fear to touch&mdash;have presented to Parliament the
petition of fifteen hundred women for the right of
franchise. This petition is so moderate and sensible,
that it deserves to be preserved.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The humble petition of the undersigned showeth,&mdash;</p>

<p>"That it having been expressly laid down by high authorities,
that the possession of property, in this country, carries
with it the right to vote in the election of representatives in
Parliament, it is an evident anomaly, that some holders of
property are allowed to use this right, while others, forming
no less a constituent part of the nation, and equally qualified
by law to hold property, are not able to exercise this privilege;
that the participation of women in the government is consistent
with the principles of the British Constitution, inasmuch
as women in these islands have always been held
capable of sovereignty, and women are eligible for various
public offices.</p>

<p>"Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray your honorable
House to consider the expediency of providing for the representation
of all householders, without distinction of sex, who
possess such property or rental qualification as your honorable
House may determine. And your petitioners will ever pray.</p></blockquote>

</ul>

<p>I append to the above petition a few of the fifteen
hundred names, which will serve to give it identity,
and interest in this country. We miss, among the
names, many names of the beloved dead; and many
would doubtless be there that we know, could it be
signed by any save property-holders.</p>

<p>A very powerful influence was brought to sustain
this petition in Parliament; and among its advocates
were James Martineau, Herbert Spencer, Professor
Huxley, and Goldwin Smith. Mr. Mill seems to
have presented a second petition, headed by Lady
Goldschmid, and signed by three thousand persons;
and another was offered, at the same time, by Mr.
Russell Gurney. On April 11, 1867, the subject of
female suffrage was first discussed in the House
of Commons without being greeted with a laugh.
A petition presented by Mr. Duncan Maclaren, from
Edinburgh, was signed by eight university professors,
six doctors of law, eighteen clergymen, eight barristers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
ten physicians, ten officers, and two thousand
other persons. Two women are said to have been
lately elected parish overseers: Mrs. Slocomb for
Brittadon, and Mrs. Craig for Bratton Fleming. The
step-daughter of John Stuart Mill, Miss Helen Taylor,
contributed to the January number of the "Westminster"
an article which worthily sustained the far
more comprehensive statement of her mother in 1851.
It would be difficult to imagine a paper, however,
that would appeal more forcibly to the English people.
There is in England a Woman-Suffrage Association,
which proposes to circulate that article as a tract.
Mrs. P.A. Taylor and Frances Power Cobbe are
among its most active members. Mrs. Bodichon has
recently brought out two pamphlets on this subject.
They contain one instance, which is not familiar, of
the inconvenience of withholding the franchise from
English women. Owners of estates seek to further
their own interest through the voting power of their
tenantry, and frequently eject women from farms, to
replace them by men who have a freehold. On one
Suffolk farm, seven women have been ejected. Among
the instances which Mrs. Bodichon adduces to show
the need of female votes are the neglect of female
education; the refusal of leases, or the ejection of old
tenants; the want of proper public spirit, which women
might be expected to infuse into affairs; and the
condition of workhouses, and charitable appropriations
in general. In Austria, information furnished
to one of Mrs. Bodichon's papers seems to show that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
the women have the same electoral rights as men,
only that in a few cases they are compelled to vote
by proxy. They vote as nobles, in their corporate
capacity as nuns, and as tax-payers or merchants;
but I need not say that there is much uncertainty in
the Austrian administration of such a law.</p>

<p>In connection with the name of Fredrika Bremer,
I have mentioned the great changes in Swedish law,
mainly due to her influence. An indirect right of
suffrage was further granted to women in 1862; but
in December, 1865, the Reform Bill gave the election
of members of the Upper Chamber to municipal and
county bodies. In the election of these bodies, women
take part. They must be unmarried or widows, be
twenty-five years old, and have more than four hundred
rixdollars per annum.</p>

<p>Article 15 of the Italian electoral law provides "that
the taxation paid by a widow, or by a wife separated
from her husband, shall give a vote to whichever of
her children or near relatives she may select."</p>

<p>A curious petition has been lately presented to the
Hungarian Diet. It is signed by a number of widows
and other women who are landed proprietors,
and asks for them the same equality of political rights
with the male inhabitants of the country, as they possessed
in 1848. These ladies represent that they have
much more difficulty in bringing up their children,
and attending to the estates, than men; that they
have to bear the same State burdens; that they are
not allowed to take part in the communal elections;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
and that, although many of them possess much more
ground than the male electors, they have no political
rights.</p>

<p>In 1848, these women were, for the first time,
excluded from the franchise.</p>


<h5>PROGRESS.</h5>

<p>The real gain of a reform, starting from the heart
of the family, must necessarily be very slow. I remember,
that some years ago, when I printed my
book on Labor, one of my kindest critics congratulated
the public, that, of my nine lectures, I had published
only these. He thought it was useless to contend for
more book-learning for women, and the subject of
civil rights still disgusted his sensitive ear. The common
sense of the book on Labor ought to have shown
him how I should treat the subject of education. He
could not understand how the woman who gets an
education which does not make her a "bread-winner,"
is essentially defrauded, nor how a woman, well paid
for her labor, is essentially wronged, when she is
denied the privilege of protecting it by her vote.
There is, however, a surely growing sense of this,
shown in the substantial advance of her civil rights.</p>

<blockquote><p>1. In the early part of 1865, the people of Victoria,
in Australia, assembled to elect a member of
Parliament, were surprised to find the whole female
population voting. Some quick-sighted woman had
discovered that the letter of the new law permitted
it; and their votes were accepted, and wisely given.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
The "London Times," in the month of May, says,
that, in a <em>country like Australia</em>, it can easily believe
that such an extension of the franchise will be a
<em>marked improvement</em>, and thinks that the precedent
will stand!</p>

<p>2. The government of Moravia has also, within the
past year, granted the municipal franchise to widows
who pay taxes.</p>

<p>3. In January, 1864, the Court of Queen's Bench
in Dublin, Ireland, restored to woman the <em>old right</em>
of voting for town commissioners. The justice (Fitzgerald)
desired to state that ladies were entitled to
sit as town commissioners as well as to vote for
them; and the chief-justice took pains to make it
clear that there was nothing in either duty repugnant
to womanly habits.</p>

<p>4. The inhabitants of Ain (or Aisne), in France,
lately chose nine women into their municipal council.</p>

<p>5. At Bergères, the whole council consisted of women;
and the mayor, not being prepared for such
good fortune, resigned his office.</p>

<p>6. Our cause has found able advocates in John Stuart
Mill, the "New-York Evening Post," and Theodore
Tilton. If I were asked, whether, in connection
with this gain, we have lost any ground, I should
reply that we have decidedly lost it in connection
with the daily press. I do not know any newspaper,
if I except the "Boston Commonwealth," which will
print a letter touching civil rights, from any woman,
precisely as it is written. I think what we need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
most is to purchase the right to a daily use of half a
column of the "New-York Tribune."</p></blockquote>


<h5>RECORD AND OBITUARIES.</h5>

<p>I have been accustomed to connect with reports of
this kind some honorable mention of distinguished
women obscure or recently dead. I cannot do this
at any length, after a pause of so many years; but
a few names must be mentioned, a few facts recorded.</p>

<p>I had occasion, some years ago, to commemorate
the services of Maria Sybilla Merian, painter, engraver,
linguist, and traveller, who published, at Amsterdam,
two volumes of engravings of insects and
sixty magnificent plates, illustrating the metamorphoses
of the insects of Surinam. I did not, at that
time, know that some of her statements had been
held open to suspicion. In the first place, she asserted,
that a certain fly, the Fulgoria Lantanaria,
emitted so much light, that she could read her books
by its aid; still further, that one of the large spiders,
called Mygale, entered the nests of the humming-bird
in Surinam, sucked its eggs, and snared the birds.
To all the contention which arose over these statements,
Madame Merian could oppose only her word.
Men who knew that her statements in regard to
Europe were indisputable decided that her word
could not be taken in Asia. A very common folly;
but two hundred years have passed, 1866 arrives,
and her justification with it. An English traveller,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
named Bates, has recently rescued quite large finches
from the Mygale, and poisoned himself with its saliva,
in preparing them for his cabinet.</p>

<p>I do not know how many years Madam Baring,
the mother of the great banker, has been dead.
It is only recently that I have heard, that to her
prudence, activity, and business habits, the family
attribute the sure foundation of their fortunes. Matthew
Baring came to Larkbeare, near Exeter, from
Bremen. His wife superintended, in his day, the long
rows of "burlers," or women who picked over the
woollen cloth he made. Her sons, John and Francis,
sought a wider field for the fortune their father
left, but did not forget to erect a monument to their
mother's industry.</p>

<p>About a year since, Eliza W. Farnham laid down
her weary head. I did not know her, nor did I sympathize
in her theories. They were sustained by her
imagination rather than her reason; by her impulses
rather than any practical judgment. No moral superiority
can justly be conferred on either sex of a being
possessed of intellect and conscience. God has conferred
no such superiority; yet I gladly name Mrs.
Farnham here as a woman whose life&mdash;a bitter disappointment
to herself&mdash;was useful to all women,
and whose books, published since her death, show a
marvellous mental range.</p>

<p>During the last year, Madame Charles Lemonnier
died in Paris. She devoted her life to the professional
education of women. For six years she found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
it so difficult to raise the necessary funds, that she
had to content herself with sending her pupils to
institutions in Germany. In 1862 the Society for
the Professional Instruction of Women was at last
constituted, and opened a school in the Rue de Perle.
Two other schools have since been opened,&mdash;one in
the Rue de Val Sainte Catherine; the other, in the
Rue Roche. The morning is occupied in these schools
with general studies; the afternoon, with industrial
drawing, wood-engraving, the making-up of garments,
linen, &amp;c. She died after initiating a thoroughly
successful work.</p>

<p>In July, 1865, there died at Corfu a Dr. Barry,
attached to the medical staff of the British army.
He was remarkable for skill, firmness, decision, and
great rapidity in difficult operations. He had entered
the army in 1813, and had served in all quarters of
the globe, with such distinction as to ensure promotion
without interest. He was clever and agreeable,
but excessively plain, weak in stature, and with a
squeaking voice which provoked ridicule. He had
an irritable temper, and answered some jesting on
the topic by calling out the offender, and shooting
him through the lungs. In 1840 he was made medical
inspector, and transferred from the Cape to Malta.
He went from Malta to Corfu; and, when the English
Government ceded the Ionian Islands to Greece,
resigned his position in the army, and remained at
Corfu. There he died last summer, forbidding, with
his latest breath, any interference with his remains.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
The women who attended him regarded this request
with the shameless indifference now so common; and
unable to believe, that an officer, who had been forty-five
years in the British service, had received a diploma,
fought a duel, and been celebrated as a brilliant
operator, was not only a woman, but at some period
in her life a <em>mother</em>; they called in a medical commission
to establish these facts. A sad, sad picture, which
those of us who inquire into the fortunes of women
can readily understand.</p>

<p>Last November deprived us of Mrs. Gaskell and
Fredrika Bremer, of whom a fuller record will be
found in the body of this work.</p>

<p>In Paris recently died Mrs. Severn Newton. She
was the daughter of the artist Severn, the friend of
Keats, who is now British Consul at Rome. About
five years since, she married Charles Newton, Superintendent
of Greek Antiquities at the British Museum.
She was a person in whom power and
delicacy were singularly blended. Ary Scheffer was
accustomed to hold up her work as a model for his
pupils. Her renderings of classic sculpture were so
true that they were termed translations; and she had
recently devoted herself to oil painting with great
success. She died of brain fever at the early age
of thirty-three, one of the most honored of female
English artists.</p>

<p>The common sense of society accepts the need of
education for women. It begs that they may be permitted
to earn their bread; but let society once grant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
the suffrage to woman, and she will take care of her
own interests. She will found colleges, distribute
opportunities, and protect vocations.</p>

<p>Education must, in time, earn independence for
most women. Independence, taxed and made a citizen
of, will insist, in the course of years, upon its
suffrage; but whoso will help to reverse the process,
and grant suffrage, so that woman may herself indicate
what education she wishes to receive, and what
labor she wishes to perform, will speed the process
by scores of years.</p>

<p>It was pleasant to see four hundred young women,
of the highest health, the best breeding, of good social
standing, and abundant means, blossoming like so
many tulips, at Vassar,&mdash;we must add, also, of good
ability, and more than average education; for only
good scholars could pass the rigid examination required
of those who enter. It was pleasant to see,
that between the ages of seventeen and twenty-two,
when society offers its greatest allurements, four hundred
wealthy girls could be found, ready to devote
themselves in seclusion, and without even the stimulus
existing at Oberlin or Antioch, to higher things.
And then, if the want of public sympathy makes it
a painful work to be always pushing the interests of
women, such teachers and officers as one finds at
Vassar compensate one for any amount of struggle.
Miss Hannah Lyman, who is now the principal; Miss
Mitchell, the astronomer; Dr. Avery, the resident
physician; and Miss Powell, the professor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
gymnastics,&mdash;it is only necessary to name to Eastern
ears: but, besides these women, Vassar employs
twenty others, in whom it would be hard to find a
fault, and some of whom, we were glad to see, had
taken their degree at Oberlin. Going westward to
Antioch, it was pleasant to find other women who had
taken their degrees, and were now teaching Greek
and Latin. One of the graduates, employed as a
teacher of mathematics, had won her own education
in the college by teaching one year,&mdash;sometimes in
distant district-schools,&mdash;and studying the next. At
Oberlin, the picture was still more inspiring: for Oberlin
has, I suppose, more pupils than any college in the
land, if we except Michigan University; and one-half
of them are girls and women. The practical working of
this college is beautiful to see. It has been fortunate
in the magnificent faith communicated to it by
Dr. Finney. Most of the women who were its early
students, and stamped its character, so that no scandal
dared invade its borders, are now the wives of its
professors, and many of them are still engaged in
teaching. Mrs. Dascomb, who is the wife of the professor
of chemistry, has been with the college from the
beginning: she is as fine a person for her position, as
lady-principal, as Miss Lyman; yet how differently
have the two been trained! Mrs. Dascomb, by isolation,
persecution, contact with the rudest elements in
Western life, yet keeping, through all, a noble faith
in manhood and womanhood; Miss Lyman, starting
from the most distinguished social circle in Northampton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
holding a high place among what Dr. Holmes
would call the "Brahmins" of Montreal, and finally
polished by a European tour, and holding control
with a power as imperceptible as it is firm. At
Milwaukee, beside Dr. Ross, to whose ten years of
successful practice I have alluded, I found another
physician, in happy partnership with one of the <em>brothers</em>
of the craft, a Dr. Glass. He has lately moved
from Minnesota to Wisconsin, where he has been
several years in partnership with Miss Fairchild, and
testifies that he has never seen her superior as a practical
physician. Here, also, a young lady, of one of
the best families, has lately opened a hair-dresser's
store. Dr. Ross gives her sweet sympathy and cheer;
but, as a proof that the world still needs converting,
she has had a good deal of that insolence to subdue
which pains just as much as if it were <em>worth</em> minding.
Any thing like the number of female lecturers which
I heard of in Illinois, I had never imagined. The
medical women are readily accepted in most places,
even without proper vouchers; and it is astonishing,
how far common sense contrives to supply the place
of education. But the want of vouchers is a serious
evil, which must soon be met. In Chicago I heard
wonderful stories of the business capacity of certain
women. One lady, very well known on Michigan
Avenue, brought one hundred thousand dollars' worth
of Chicago City bonds to Boston and New York, and
safely sold them for her husband. A farmer's wife,
from the centre of the State, came up, while I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
there, to speculate in corn. She said her husband
had lost money several years in succession, and now
<em>she</em> was going to try. By her first speculation, she
made five thousand dollars; and this she put into
competent hands, for re-investment. It gained her
twenty thousand dollars. The Chicago merchants
thought that she would go on speculating until she
lost it all; but I do not. I think our Pleasant-street
Hospital has proved that women are more cautious
than men, and are willing to bear a good deal of
obloquy rather than permit rash ventures to be made.</p>

<p>In the country, everywhere, I heard charming anecdotes
of the vigor and self-sacrifice women showed in
the early settlement of the States.</p>

<p>It happened one spring, that, when the ice broke up
on the Fox River, a terrible storm of wind and sleet
and rain came with it. Not a man in the State, however
great the emergency, would have thought that he
could cross. In this state of things, a woman was
taken in childbirth, some two or three miles from the
ferry. Just as the ferry-woman was going to bed, in
the "outer darkness" of that terrible storm, she heard
her name shouted from the opposite bank. She listened,
and a grievous story was shouted across. She
went to the stable and saddled her mare, and, all alone,
forded the stream: the floating ice, heaped into walls,
struck the sides of the faithful beast, and tore the
woman's skirt to tatters. Now and then a flash of
lightning showed her what progress she had made.
At last, she struggled to the bank, and gave the needful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
help. Nobody ever asked how she got back. On
the grass about Elgin, a whole ship's load died of
cholera, nearly forty years ago. All the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'neigborhood'">neighborhood</ins>
stood back in dread; but I saw one aged woman, who
closed the eyes of nine, and received the foreign blessing,
which she felt, although she could not understand.
In Quincy, I found two ladies just establishing a high
school for girls, whom I have previously mentioned as
having pushed through the endowment, for women,
of the State University at Lawrence, and having
opened a class in modelling in clay, under Professor
Volkers. At the Cooper Institute I found more
women at work than ever before, and to better advantage.
A large class had just been formed to color
photographs on glass, porcelain, and paper. Under
such circumstances, we need not be disheartened
because an ignorant woman, in a man's costume, has
found the way to attract some attention in Europe
and some contempt from Tom Hughes. Neither need
it dismay us that the "Boston Advertiser" thinks
the Equal-Rights meetings, in New York, have not
been largely attended. There are those who want
the suffrage, who do not care to encourage women to
offer themselves for Congress before public opinion
can accept them, and who are sufficiently disgusted
by what looks like a mannish coalition with Democrats,
to keep away from public meetings.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the women of Parma clamor for the
right to vote for Victor Emanuel. A freedwoman,
Charlotte Scott, proposes a monument, on behalf of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
her emancipated race, to President Lincoln; and the
noble inspiration of Harriet Hosmer carries out the
thought.</p>

<p>But the very things we turn from force the necessary
issues on the world. Wise action would never
have brought the recent debate in Congress; nor prudent
measures have secured thirty votes for Mrs.
Stanton, and nine senatorial ballots for female suffrage.
Once agitated in these quarters, the matter
draws nearer to a final test.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> This does not mean the supervision of father and mother,
but that into colleges, universities, medical schools, and whatever
educational institutions may be named, the controlling and protecting
influence of both sexes should be carried. I believe that every
university should have a cultivated and elegant woman (not necessarily
the <em>wife</em> of any of its officers), whose duty it should be to preside
over its social life, and offer such allurements to virtuous pleasure
that gambling-houses and worse shall lose their present fascinations. If
young men could associate with virtuous and lovely women, under suitable
sanction, in their college life, they would not, in general, go out of
it in search of the vicious and unlovely. No one who lives within three
miles of a large university need doubt the meaning of this paragraph. An
age and a religious faith which discards the cloister, should discard a
cloisteral fashion, wherever it exists.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> "Society offered her no welcome." I am very well aware that
this statement, taken with what I shall elsewhere indicate, will be
considered an exaggeration; but, with a somewhat wide and varied
experience of the United States and of Canada, I maintain it to be true.
I am not to say what is true in the eyes of others, but what is true in
my own. "What!" some one will exclaim, "education not a passport to
social honor! Where was there ever a country where the teacher was
respected as she is in New England?" Theoretically, this is true; and I
have known a few instances in New England, in which teachers of private
schools, of good family, successful in acquiring wealth (not necessarily
through their schools), kept an eminent social position. Men generally
keep a fair position; women, rarely. To test the truth of this, let me
press the question. To whom do we all, to whom does the Commonwealth,
owe a sacred debt, if not to the teachers of the primary and the grammar
schools? Among these women, I have found some of the most delicate,
high-bred, and cultivated women whom I have ever known of the same age.
Let any one who sees them collected on public occasions glance at them,
and judge; but, in cities at least, these women are never in society.
Their meagre salaries prevent them from dressing as ladies must be
dressed for a large company. For the same reason, their boarding-places
are obscure and lonely. The middle class of artisans, &amp;c., who send
their children to the public schools, seek no intercourse with those
whose refinement seems to isolate them; the upper class look down upon
them very kindly, but never think of inviting them to meet distinguished
people, of showing them rare books or pictures, of stimulating their
worn-out faculties in any way. Why do we not make these teachers our
first care? Should we not be more than repaid&mdash;if pay we must have&mdash;by
the cheer and comfort added to the schoolroom in which our children are
to be taught? I have tried the experiment of bringing these tired souls
into contact with those who ought to refresh them. It does marvellously
well, until the crucial question is asked, "Who is she?" If I answer,
"The teacher of a primary school," what a change of countenance, what a
fading of the cordial smile, what passive indifference! and this, in
cases where, in refinement and delicacy of manner, the young lady might
pass unchallenged anywhere. But let the subject of my experiment be a
girl of genius; with such cultivation only as a Normal School could add
to the education of a country home; deficient still in the minor graces
of deportment; too energetic and adventurous, perhaps, to be elegant;
and who will take a motherly interest in her, draw her within the
charmed circle where she shall learn to carry herself with reserve and
dignity, and to veil her flashing powers, that they may warm where they
have hitherto consumed?</p>

<p>No: I do not exaggerate. I believe we are all concerned to know in what
sort of homes, under what influences, with what helps to health and
happiness, these lonely and isolated girls pass the hours when they are
not engaged in teaching. It concerns us, in the first place, of course,
because theirs are the direct influences which mould our children; but I
scorn that argument. It concerns us far more because they are the
children of the same Father, engaged in the most trying of human
vocations, and entitled as women, especially as unprotected women, to
the sympathy of all mothers.</p>

<p>Some years ago, a lady not yet out of her teens, and suddenly reduced in
fortune, went to Virginia to teach. She had letters from persons of
distinction, who had known her in her early home. The letters were
delivered; but there the matter ended. But she was one of those persons
who make a place for themselves; and, after the neighborhood grew proud
of her, she was called down one day to meet the wife of a lieutenant in
the navy, to whom one of her letters had been addressed. "I am sorry I
have not called before," apologized the visitor; "but there are so many
of <em>these teachers</em>!" She had no time to say more: the young girl's
cheek kindled. "Madam," said she, springing to her feet, "I desire no
attention from you which would not under any circumstances be accorded
to your daughter's teacher;" and she left the room. It is a matter of
small importance, that, in this case, the young teacher was soon placed
in a position in which her good-will became important to the
lieutenant's wife.</p>

<p>"This," you will say, "was at the South. It grew out of that spirit of
'caste' which died with slavery." Is it indeed dead? Is there no spirit
of caste in Massachusetts?</p></div>

but they record a fact which occurred at a medical school, where such an
application was made, and must stand as history.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The three parts of this book have been made to conform to
the census and statistics of the year 1850. To bring them up to the year
1860 would require a repetition of all the labor originally devoted to
the question. That would be unwise if it were possible, for it could not
alter the bearing of any statements; and it is not possible, because we
have now no certain values in America. I had from the first intended to
indicate in notes any important changes that had taken place in this
decade. I had earnestly hoped to be able to contradict here the
statements in the text in regard to medical opportunities for women, and
the proper training of sick nurses, in England. But my English
correspondents assure me that I have no occasion to change any thing;
that the facts remain substantially what they were when my manuscript
was written.</p>

<p>"But," says some watchful woman, "has not Miss Garrett taken her degree
from Apothecaries' Hall? and have not a few women at least been trained
as sick nurses?"</p>

<p>There is still no <em>institution</em> for the training of sick nurses, as the
text asserts. Some few have been trained in hospitals and the like, on
conditions of service, or to supply the need of such institutions
themselves. How does the matter stand with Miss Garrett? The press has
made the most of her success: it lies with us to exhibit the naked
truth. After applying in vain to the various medical colleges, Miss
Garrett went to Apothecaries' Hall. Here they refused her; but she
looked up their charter. She found the word indicating to whom degrees
should be granted indeterminate, with no character of sex attached to
it. Lawyers told her the hall must grant her a degree, or surrender its
charter. She was wealthy, and in earnest. She pushed her advantage. "The
Apothecaries' Hall" prescribed certain courses of instruction to be
pursued and certified before the degree could be granted. These she
pursued in private, paying the most exorbitant rates for her
instruction. In one instance, for a course of lectures, to which a man's
fee would have been <em>five</em> guineas, she paid <em>fifty</em>; and I am credibly
informed that the round cost of these preparatory steps must have
amounted to two thousand pounds. All honor to Miss Garrett! Should her
genius as a physician equal her energy and her wealth, she may gain
something for the cause she has espoused, by the honor and consideration
she will win for her sex. Apart from this, it will be seen, she has
gained nothing. Bribery is not possible to ordinary mortals; and the
conditions of the degree, in the present state of public feeling, would
make it wholly impracticable.</p>

<p>The case, as it has been stated to us, is an exemplification, on a
gigantic scale, of all that we complain of; and proves our statement,
that women have not won an education for themselves, till they win with
it its legitimate results. For their opportunities as things now stand,
all over the world, women pay a premium on the terms offered to men. Let
them take these opportunities as tools, and try to win their bread with
them, and the wages offered are, as a rule, a large discount on those
offered to men. Political economy has nothing to do with the exceptional
cases in which this is most evident,&mdash;only the common, habitual idea,
that the wages of women must be kept down; and that, to do it, the value
of superior labor must not be recognized, as in the case of the female
teacher quoted in the text.</p>

<p>In the Report of St. Mary's Dispensary for Women and Children, in
Marylebone, I find Miss Elizabeth Garrett mentioned as the General
Medical Attendant. The Devonshire-square Nursing Institute, established,
I think, by Mrs. Fry, twenty years ago, sends out nurses on the request
of clergymen. Several sisters give their whole time to it.</p>

<p>King's College pays one thousand pounds annually for nurses to St.
John's Home.</p>

<p>St. Thomas's Hospital, where nurses are being trained by the Nightingale
fund, rejected fifty applications in six months.</p>

<p>The excitement in England has had a wholesome effect upon colonial
action. The East-Indian Government has lately given Lady Canning
twenty thousand rupees, to assist in building a home for the Calcutta Nurses'
Institute; and a movement is making in India to educate native women as
physicians. See, in the Appendix, the account of Miss Nightingale's School
for Nurses in Liverpool.</p>

<p>Since the above was written, in January, 1867, three ladies have taken
their degrees at Apothecaries' Hall, having passed a good examination, in
Euclid, arithmetic, English history, and Latin. The <em>cost</em> of these degrees
has not transpired.</p></div>

think that the state of things represented in the text has long passed away.
People who know nothing of the value of money talk a great deal about
"increase of wages," and are apt to say that any honest woman can now get
a living. Women's wages are at this moment of less value than they were
before the war; and, to confirm the foregoing statements, I add here the
statements of my friend Mrs. Corbin, which reach me as I go to press:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At a meeting of the Liberal Christian League, held at Rev. Robert
Collyer's church, on Sunday evening, Feb. 3, a report was read by the
Chairman of the Committee on Friendless Women, from which the following
is an extract:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Your Committee aimed [in visiting houses of ill-fame], in Chicago, to find out,
as nearly as possible, the general facts concerning the lives of this class of women.</p>

<p>It was found that these women of pleasure, as they are called, instead of leading
the idle and luxurious life which many imagine, are, in fact, the most steadily employed
of any class in the community, and have the least available leisure. Your
Committee have never yet visited a house of this kind, staying on the average half
an hour, but they have found male visitors, either there when they entered, or coming
in before they left; and this in the open day. Inquiries put to the women
concerning their hours of leisure developed incidentally the fact, that it is only at
certain times, on certain days, that they can get out; and then it must be strictly in
the prosecution of their calling. The terms on which these women are kept, are
usually a certain stipulated sum per week for room rent, and, over and above this, the
half of their earnings; which makes it necessary for the keepers to have a constant
eye upon the girls, to prevent their taking money outside. The number of men supporting
these houses is, moreover, so much greater than the number of women
supported therein, that every girl is kept in constant requisition, either at the house,
or as a walking advertisement on the street and at public places.</p>

<p>Your Committee, before making these visits, were constantly assured that these
women preferred this way of life, and would scout the efforts of their own sex at
reforming them. Your Committee take great pleasure in reporting, that, in every
instance, they have found this charge <em>utterly unsustained</em>. Everywhere doors were
freely opened to them; they were treated with as much politeness and cordiality as
they have ever received in the most respectable houses; and the conversation was of
the freest and most satisfactory character.</p>

<p>'Are you happy in this life?' was asked of a delicate girl in her teens, who had
been seen, five minutes before, dancing and singing about a man in an adjoining
apartment in the most wanton manner,&mdash;'Are you happy in this life?'</p>

<p>Tears, sudden and sincere, with a look of indignant protest, filled her eyes, as she
answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>'Think how we have to treat the men: that of itself is enough to prevent
<em>any woman</em> from being happy.'</p>

<p>'But you do not always talk this way to men?' was the reply.</p>

<p>'Oh, no!' she said; 'I would never tell a <em>man</em> that. We always tell the men that
we like this life, and would not live any other, if we could; but <em>women know</em>.'</p>

<p>Another voluntarily mentioned the intemperance with which they are universally
and justly charged, as one of the hard necessities of their position. Women ought
not to drink, she admitted; but they would die if they did not, or go mad with
anguish and despair.</p>

<p>Your Committee feel, that, at the present stage of investigation, it may seem
premature to speak of the causes of this terrible evil; this slavery, which their
observation assures them is more degrading and horrible than any other upon the
face of the earth: but two causes have met them so constantly face to face, that they
cannot in justice refrain from mentioning them.</p>

<p>The first is the terribly prevalent and everywhere tolerated licentiousness of men.
Your Committee believe it to be an admitted fact, that, if to-day every woman of
abandoned life could suddenly be removed from the dens of this city and placed in a
respectable position, it would not be six months before their places would be filled,
from the ranks of women who are now virtuous; and they have no faith in any
system of reform which does not strike effectual blows at this, the mainspring of the
evil.</p>

<p>Over against this, the first great pillar of the institution, stands the almost equally
colossal one of poverty, and the exclusion of women from the ordinary fields of labor.</p>

<p>'Here is what I work for,' said a fine, strong-looking woman, as she placed her
hand on the head of a bright boy of two years. 'He is my child. I have him to
support. There is no other way in which I could earn a comfortable subsistence for
myself and him.'</p>

<p>Another, the keeper of a house of ill-fame, an intelligent, graceful, refined-looking
woman,&mdash;a woman who would have been an ornament to any society,&mdash;said:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I was left suddenly poor, with my mother to support. I had never been used to
work, and there seemed no work I could do that would support us both. The
circumstances of my life seemed to force me into this way of living;' which meant,
of course, that some man stood ready to offer her kindness, protection, support, every
thing but marriage, and she accepted it. 'My mother, to-day, is as innocent of any
knowledge of my way of life, as a saint in heaven. I live in daily terror and solicitude
lest she should find it out, for it would kill her. I am going soon on a visit to her,
and shall carry with me twelve hundred and fifty dollars, with which to secure her a
home for life; so that, whatever happens to me, she will be provided for.'</p>

<p>In confirmation of this story, a hack came to the door while she was speaking, to
carry her to the train she had previously indicated; which fact, together with her
earnest and sincere manner, left no doubt in the minds of your Committee concerning
the truthfulness of her story.</p>

<p>In regard to the series of meetings proposed to be inaugurated, your Committee
are obliged for the present to report unfavorably, for the following reasons:&mdash;</p>

<p>The proposition was everywhere cordially met among the women. They readily
agreed to the usefulness of the project, and mentioned only one objection, and that to
time. 'Sunday,' was the invariable answer, 'is our busiest day. We could hardly
get away at all on that day; but we will try to do so.' Your Committee saw at once
the blunder they had made in forgetting that Sunday is the leisure day of men; and
therefore went to the first appointed meeting, through a cold and blinding snowstorm,
with little hope of success. They found the room already occupied by some
six or eight street roughs, evidently waiting for what might transpire. They left the
room very soon, but took their station about the door, and remained there as long as
the Committee did. Subsequent inquiries confirmed the impression, that they were
sent there by some of the men who had been in the houses at the time of the visits,
to break up the meetings, for which purpose, of course, only their presence would be
necessary.</p>

<p>Beyond this determined opposition which would no doubt be encountered at the
hands of the male supporters of the institution, your Committee see but one serious
difficulty; and that is, the deep-rooted scepticism which prevail among the women
concerning any general sentiment of Christian charity in their behalf. They have so
long been persecuted with unjust opprobrium, abandoned, outcast, left to live or die
as they might, without one word of pity or encouragement, while the men who shared
their sins, and were oftentimes the guiltier partners, were the honored and trusted
associates of Christian women, pillars perhaps in Christian churches, that they have
naturally come to feel, that the sympathy of one or two good women, however earnest
and grateful it may be in itself, will be of little avail against the malignity of the
whole banded world.</p>

<p>Still your Committee have seen nothing, so far, to discourage them in their
efforts, but every thing to impress upon them the feeling of imperative duty in this
direction.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 3em;">(Signed)</span> <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Mrs. <span class="smcap">C.F. Corbin</span>, Chairman.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>"The plan of action proposed by this Committee was to visit the women
in a friendly, Christ-like spirit, inaugurate a series of meetings among them,
organize efforts in the direction of saving their money, so that they might be
able to take an independent position, with only such moral support as should
be necessary to enable them to face the opposition of the world, and to direct
their lavish free-heartedness into channels of benevolence toward the old and
worn-out of their number. Pure and healthful pleasures would also be provided
for them, good music, the reading of fine poems and interesting stories,
and so a beginning made toward introducing principles of steadiness and
sobriety into their now totally abandoned and desperate lives."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> I do not know that any person has ever practically carried out Legouvé's
estimate of labor as a moral help, but Marie de Lamourous, the
foundress of the House of Mercy at Bourdeaux. This was a refuge for
ruined women, whom she trained to self-support. Some one offered her a
sum sufficient to insure her family a comfortable living; but she wisely refused
it. "No false pretences," she said: "if we are not compelled to
labor, we shall not labor. An idle mind makes its own temptations. I can
do nothing without work."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> When woman's power to work is called in question, men almost always
remark, that she has shown no <em>inventive</em> genius whatever. Should a proper
history of the arts ever be written, this will be found to be an entire mistake.
Patentees are not always inventors; and many of these, after hopeless labor
carried on for years, have owed a final success to some woman's power of
adaptation. We need not, however, take refuge in general statement, nor
in the traditional fact that she invented spindle, distaff, needle, and scissors.
Any new-born barbarian, pressed by necessity, might accomplish so
much. The most delicate and beautiful obstetrical instruments were invented
by Madame Boivin. Madame Ducoudray invented the manikin;
Madame Breton, the system of artificial nourishment for babes; Morandi
and Bihéron adapted wax to the purposes of medical illustration; and it
was to the observations of Mademoiselle Bihéron, recorded in wax, that Dr.
Hunter owed the illustrations of his best work. He was her generous
friend; but she preceded him seven years in this direction, and may possibly
have given him the right to use her observations as his own. Madame
Rondet has, in the present century, invented a tube to be used in cases of
restoration from asphyxia. It is easy to quote these cases from the history
of medicine, because an honest French physician has taken pains to preserve
them; but the following instances of inventive and mechanical power
may be less known:&mdash;</p>

<p>In 1823, <em>the first patent of invention</em> was taken out in Paris by Madame
Dutillet, for the formation of artificial marble. This was so successful a
patent, that she sold it in 1824; and the purchaser renewed it, with still
further improvements.</p>

<p>In 1836, Burrows, an Englishman, took out a patent for cement. Madame
Bex, of Paris, found this cement a failure in damp places, and published a
method of less limited application, in which bitumen was employed.</p>

<p>In 1840, Mrs. Marshall, once of Manchester, England, and now of Edinburgh,
was struck with the idea, that the electric forces evolved by decaying
animal and vegetable matter, acting upon calcareous substances, must have
much to do with the natural formation of marble. In five years, by upwards
of ten thousand experiments, she perfected an artificial marble, whose
constituents and manufacture were entirely within control, and which could
be made in hours or months, at the maker's volition. To this cement she
gave the simple Italian name of <em>intonuca</em>. It is singular that she should so
intuitively have seized this secret; for, under Madame Dutillet's patent, we
are expressly informed that all vegetable matter must be removed from the
composition, if we would have the cement indestructible. The example
is an interesting one; for the ten thousand disagreeable experiments show
that one woman at least possessed the power of persistent application, of
long-protracted labor, so often denied.</p>

<p>
Starch first came into use in England in 1564. It was carried thither
by a Mrs. Dinghen Vanden Plasse, of Flanders, who set up business as a professed
starcher, and instructed others how to use the article for five pounds,
and how to make it for twenty pounds.</p>

<p>Side-saddles for ladies first came into use in 1138. Anne, queen of
Richard II., introduced these to the English ladies.</p>

<p>The braiding of straw in this country was first begun in Providence, in
1798, by Mrs. Betsey Baker, lately residing in Dedham, Mass. The first
bonnet she made was of seven straws with bobbin let in like open-work, and
lined with pink satin.</p>

<p>I had hoped to add to these names that of a peasant woman, who successfully
drained a large estate in France after her own original fashion, and
was sent from Paris to do the same in French Guiana for the government;
but, although no phantom, she eludes my researches.</p></div>

such sale, in August, 1859, disgraced the English nation. Opposite the
brewery, at Dudley, in Staffordshire, not many miles from Kidderminster
and Birmingham, a man named Pensotte sold his wife, with a halter round
her neck, for sixpence. He had previously dragged her&mdash;a three weeks'
bride&mdash;three quarters of a mile in this state. It is intimated in this case,
that she was not faithful; but it is the first time I ever saw such a charge
attached to such an account. Americans are anxious to understand this
outrage. Is it possible that a government which forbids the sale of a negro
cannot forbid the sale of a Saxon wife? What shadow of law sustains the
custom? Is the woman supposed to be sold into wifehood or servitude? I
have taken it for granted that the word "mare" shows that she is regarded
as a beast of burden. It is impossible for the fairest and loftiest woman in
England&mdash;nay, for Victoria herself&mdash;not to suffer, in some degree, from
the public opinion which such transactions, ever so rarely occurring, tend
to form.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> When I first began to lecture, many persons, sincerely interested in my
success, objected to what they called the "antagonistic" tone occasionally
adopted. They thought I ought to take for granted the cheerful co-operation
of the world, and that the woman's cause was the loser whenever the
audience was reminded of actual difficulties in the way. But it would be
hardly worth while for a woman to enter the desk, only to hedge it in with
compromise and evasion. The simple truth is the "utmost skill" she needs
to seek; and no reform built upon an inaccurate survey can be lasting.
Only by telling our brothers openly what we think of their jealousy can we
ever hope to shame them out of it. That the day of opposition is <em>not</em> passed;
that the way of duty cannot, even in America, be trod in satin slippers,&mdash;the
following extract, cut from a weekly paper while I am writing this note,
will plainly show:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Pennsylvania Medical Society has exhibited a narrow-mindedness
altogether disgraceful to its members, by adopting a resolution recommending
'the members of the regular profession to withhold from the faculties and
graduates of Female Medical Colleges all countenance and support; and that
they cannot, consistently with sound <em>medical ethics</em>, consult or hold professional
intercourse with their professors or alumni.' The Female Medical
Colleges of Pennsylvania, it should be remembered, are strictly allopathic: so
we are forced to conclude, that the objection to them is founded <em>solely</em> upon the
fact that they afford the means of education to women. We echo the sentiment
of the 'Philadelphia Sunday Dispatch:' 'Shame upon the men who,
while prating about their respectability, would combine to rob women of the
means of supporting themselves and their families! Such infinitesimal
littleness cannot benefit them. The public are ever willing to aid the weak,
and support them against the strong. The war against women cannot be
sustained by the public voice: it will recoil upon and injure those who are so
arbitrary and selfish as to endeavor to interfere with them.'"&mdash;<em>Antislavery
Standard</em>, July, 1859.</p>

<p>"The medico-chirurgical school of Lisbon has granted the diploma of
<em>pharmacienne</em> to Mesdames Marie Fajardo and Caroline de Matos, after
a legal examination. These illustrious <em>pharmaceuticas</em> have a regular knowledge
of their business, and passed a preliminary examination in 1859.
'The Gazette' does not say if they are <em>religieuses</em> charged with the management
of a private pharmacy, or whether they are acting as civil <em>pharmaciennes</em>.
In one of the hospitals of the city is a female dispenser, whose
knowledge, accuracy, and care are said to be reliable and satisfactory."</p></div>

fifty women are at work with one hundred and fifty men, they are only
"tending machines;" so that, although employment is open, a career can
hardly be said to be. The watches made at Waltham by machinery are
said to be so superior to all others, that they are used by preference on the
race-courses to time the horses. Men and women do not compete with each
other there; but both are at service, with a steam-engine for their master.</p>

<p>For the first two months, the women earn two dollars and fifty cents

earn from five shillings to two dollars a <em>day</em>. It seems that no special skill
is required in the women, while the men in a few departments are still paid
according to their ability. The steam-engine, it appears, has not yet learned
how to cook dials! In this case, the operator must hold the dial, turning it
evenly, as if he were a smoke-jack, which requires judgment and "faculty"!</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> I am happy to find, on the authority of the "London Athenæum,"
that this statement was, when I wrote it, untrue. "Germany," it says, on
the 23d of July, 1859,&mdash;"Germany has lost one of her most famed and
eminent female scholars. Frau Dr. Heidenreich, <em>née</em> Von Siebold, died at
Darmstadt a fortnight ago. She was born in 1792, studied the science of
midwifery at the Universities of Göttingen and Giessen, and took her doctor's
degree in 1817; not, <i xml:lang="Latn">honoris causâ</i>, by favor of the Faculty, but, like any
other German student, by writing the customary Latin dissertation, as well
as by bravely defending, in public disputation, a number of medical theses.
After that, she took up her permanent abode at Darmstadt, indefatigable in
the exercise of her special branch of science, and universally honored as one
of its first living authorities."</p>

<p>"Universally honored as one of its first living authorities," that was what
I was in search of; and French and German papers confirm the statement.
Dr. Heidenreich came of a family highly distinguished in her specialty. It
was ancient and noble: she was a baroness in her own right. All readers of
English works on midwifery know the authority given to the name of Von
Siebold. Her father founded the famous hospital at Berlin; and her brother,
still living, stands high in medical fame, having written the best history of
midwifery extant.</p>

<p>Rosa Bonheur, also, is as unquestionably at the head of her department
as Sir Edmund Landseer. The three pictures Boston has had a chance to see
this autumn ought to fill every woman's bosom with a glow of honest pride.</p>

<p>I can find no better place than this, perhaps, to introduce the following
facts, to which my attention has been directed by the kindness of Miss Mary
L. Booth, of New York.</p>

<p>In the History of Southold, N.Y.,&mdash;one of the oldest towns in the United
States,&mdash;it appears that women have practised there as "doctresses" and
"midwives" from the first settlement of the country. From 1740 to the
present time,&mdash;more than one hundred years,&mdash;the town of Southold has
had a trustworthy female physician. The first of these, Elizabeth King,
who practised from 1740 until her death in 1780, attended at the birth of
more than <em>one thousand</em> children.</p>

<p>During this time,&mdash;from 1760 to 1775,&mdash;a Mrs. Peck was also known in
the same town as an excellent midwife. The direct successor of Mrs. King
was, however, a Mrs. Lucretia Lester, who practised from 1745 to 1779. Of
her my authority says, "She was justly respected as nurse and doctress
to the pains and infirmities incident to her fellow-mortals, <em>especially</em> her own
sex;" a remark which shows she attended <em>both</em>. "She was, during thirty
years, conspicuous as an angel of mercy; a woman whose price was beyond
rubies. It is said she attended at the birth of <em>thirteen hundred</em> children, and,
of that number, lost but two."</p>

<p>A Mrs. Susannah Brown practised from 1800 to 1840, and attended at the
birth of <em>fourteen hundred</em> children. From the number of patients these
women must have had, it would seem as if they were sustained by the whole
neighborhood. The book just published speaks highly of them, as what
Henry Ward Beecher would call a "means of grace," and pleads, from the
precedent, for the education of women to medicine.</p>

<p>Southold is in Suffolk County, on Long Island; and was settled in the
early part of the seventeenth century. It has now three churches, and less
than five thousand inhabitants.</p>

<p>The instance of so creditable a practice being maintained for a whole century,
by three women, stands alone, so far as I know, in this country. Mrs.
King probably studied abroad, and taught her next successor, and possibly
Mrs. Peck, who seems to have assisted both. That three of the four women
named should have practised forty years each, seems very remarkable.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_28_28" id="Footnote_28_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> I did not think, certainly, when I wrote the above passage, of Arthur
Helps's "Companions of my Solitude;" but, taking up the book during a
day of illness, I find a parallel passage in what he writes of the "sin of great
cities." In speaking of the many excuses which ought to be made for fallen
women, he says: "And then there is nobody into whose ear the poor girl
can pour her troubles, <em>except she comes as a beggar</em>. This will be said to be
a leaning, on my part, to the confessional. I cannot help this: I must speak
the truth that is in me."</p>

<p>It seems to me, that the "narrow" church, against which so much is intimated
in our times, is nowhere so narrow as in its human sympathies. Oh
that our clergymen knew how many utterly <em>friendless</em> souls sit before them
clothed in "purple and fine linen"! It is not to be taken for granted, that,
because a woman has a home, a father and mother, and a genial, social circle,
she has a <em>friend</em>, or even a counsellor. It is not the beggar-girl alone who
needs a "Confessor" within our Protestant churches. Many of the most
refined, the most noble, and the most wealthy, are hurried into unfit marriages,
because they dare not live alone, and think the superficial confidences
of common courtship only a prelude to something deeper which never comes.</p>

<p>Why should not the "Comforter" have come to our churches, with some
special significance, before this? If stout-hearted Luther could say, "When
I am assailed with heavy tribulations, I rush out among my pigs, rather
than remain alone by myself," why should any of us blush to confess our
need of help? Herein, it seems to me, lies the vital want of the modern
church. Here and there, the rare personal gifts of a single pastor lessen the
evil; but what we want, in every religious circle, is a friend to whom we can
go, without the smallest danger of being suspected of impertinence or egotism,
under the sanction of the divine words, "Bear ye one another's burdens."
The burdens of temptation <em>must</em> be borne alone; but the burdens of poverty,
sickness, and grief, should be shared in every Christian church, without
regard to the social condition of the sufferer. Oftentimes the rich man is
poorer than the pauper. I know all the objections that will be raised. I <em>feel</em>,
to this day, how I saw one clergyman shrink, years ago, from a tale which
he ought to have heard from one agonized woman's lips; and how others,
admirable in the usual pulpit and pastoral charge, will think themselves unfit
for this. Under such circumstances, let a clergyman call upon those of his
congregation who are willing to become the friends of the rest, to meet in his
study. From the half-dozen who will have at once the <em>modesty</em> and the
courage to come forward, let a man and a woman be chosen to act as a
"Committee of Comfort." This might be done with the utmost quietness;
the minister alone need know the names of those willing to serve; but if it
were an understood thing, that every church had such officers, the blessing
would be beyond belief.</p>

<p>In many cases, no actual help could be given, beyond patient listening, a
mutual prayer, or tender soothing; but in every church there are souls that
need these far more than eloquent preaching,&mdash;souls that ask for nothing,
except some one to hear and consider <em>who is not in a hurry</em>, some one to
appoint those to their true uses who stand idle in a waiting world. I claim
such an institution for the sake of friendless <em>women</em>; but such substitutes for
it as the world has hitherto had, have been by no means useless to <em>men</em>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_29_29" id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> I must suggest, in this connection, a thought which I have not had
time to elaborate in the text. Very much needed in Boston is a restaurant
for the lower classes, presided over by the highest skill and intelligence,
where well-cooked, well-flavored, and <em>stimulating</em> food could be offered at all
times; and where a judicious alternation of pea soup, baked beans, and very
simple dishes, with roast meat and broths, might secure daily nourishment
for a very low price. There is a great deal of very cheap food, which an
epicure might desire, but which the poor have never been taught to prepare.
Hundreds of wretched families in Boston ought never to try to make a cup
of tea for themselves. In hot weather, the shavings and wood necessary to
boil the water are worth as much as the tea itself. Crime of all sorts, and
especially intemperance, will retreat before a proper provision of nourishing
and stimulating food for the lower classes. Gallons of oyster liquor are
thrown away every day by dealers who sell the fish "solid," which would
make the most nourishing of soups and stews; for no food replenishes the
vital essences so rapidly as the oyster: hence its inseparable connection with
all places of dissipation and vicious resort. If men would only make a good
instead of an evil use of the few natural secrets they discover! With such
a restaurant,&mdash;which should, of course, be self-supporting,&mdash;a capital
training-school for cooks might easily be associated; and so it would become
an infinite blessing, in the end, to the kind hearts and wise heads
of those who should project it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_30_30" id="Footnote_30_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> This allusion was made before an American audience, to show that the
defeats suffered in a noble cause are honored in time as victories. So strong
is our popular delusion on this point, that few of the common people can be
found willing to believe that we were actually defeated at Bunker Hill. It
was our "first battle." All honor to all such!</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> I cannot allude to the subject of Intelligence-offices without saying,
that all such institutions ought to be brought, in some <em>new</em> and <em>effective</em> manner,
under public supervision and control.</p>

<p>A private Intelligence-office, kept in the superintendent's own house,
cannot be interfered with, unless it can be proved a nuisance; and how difficult
it is to abate a nuisance I need not tell anybody who has ever tried the
experiment.</p>

<p>The keeper of a General or Public Intelligence-office makes application for
a license to the city government, sustained by a certain number of respectable
vouchers, and pays, I believe, a yearly fee of one dollar.</p>

<p>This looks fair enough; and, if every officer of the city government, from
the lowest police-officer to the mayor, were immaculate, it would be so; but
we all know what the fact is. It is an open secret, that, in all our largest
cities, the marts of vice are stocked from these places, and that they serve
the purposes of bad men better than houses of professedly vicious resort.
One of the most excellent and respectable women I know, who superintends
one of these offices, told me herself that four women made assignations on
her premises, and went out of her office to keep them, without her having
power to prevent it. She proved the correctness of her suspicions by employing
one of her vouchers to watch the result. If this happens under the
eyes of the virtuous and vigilant, what <em>may</em> not happen when the head of
the establishment is in the pay of interested parties? I do not know in
what way this wickedness can be broken up; but, in the words of Dr.
Gannett, "what <em>must</em> be done, can be." Is it not a terrible thought, that
fashionable women and tender girls should supply themselves with servants
from the very brink of that hell they believe they have never touched? Is
it not a far more terrible thought, that an innocent stranger cannot seek her
daily bread without running the risk of certain perdition? How real these
possibilities are, there are those in this city able to testify.</p>

<p>Ought not the ministers at large, of all denominations, and our overseers
of the poor, to unite in prompt and efficient action in this regard?</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

great subject of Roman legislation for women, in the noble and extended
manner which is at once, as it seems to me, necessary and possible. Perhaps
I shall never become so.</p>

<p>It seems to me proper, however, that I should indicate my dissatisfaction
with existing methods in the clearest manner, and drop a few hints, as I do in
the text, as to the difficulties in the way.</p>

<p>Roman sepulchral inscriptions, of the era generally considered the most
licentious, bear witness in the fullest manner to the existence of chastity and
domestic virtue. A sepulchral inscription, it may be argued, is a poor witness
to facts. I would suggest in reply, that a nation ceases to commemorate
the virtue which has ceased to exist, or which it has, through a general depravity
of manners, ceased to respect.</p></div>

many absurdities are never or very rarely dragged into the light of a

<p><a name="Footnote_35_35" id="Footnote_35_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_35"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> A curious instance of the immoral result of holding marriage sacramental,
and indissoluble under all circumstances, comes within my personal
experience while I am correcting these pages for the press, Oct. 11, 1861.</p>

<p>A young Catholic girl was divorced some years ago, immediately after
marriage, on account of the bad conduct of her husband. She was received
into the family of a brother-in-law, in every way highly respectable. For
the last two years, she has been courted by an officer in the navy of the
United States; but nowhere in New England could a Catholic priest be
found willing to marry them. The church still holds her responsible to her
first vows. The officer honestly desired to marry her; but the natural result
of her ignorance and perplexity followed. Expecting to become a mother,
and rejected by her family, she came to me for advice. As the officer is a
Protestant, I recommended that they should be married by a minister of that
faith. She again consulted her priest, and was told that it was less sinful
for her to remain in her present relation to her lover than to receive a sacrament
from unholy hands; the priest ignoring utterly the <em>legal</em> protection
and maintenance which she might thus receive.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_36_36" id="Footnote_36_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_36"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> The only excuse for considering this point, in an essay pleading especially
for women, is that the law bears unequally on the two sexes; pressing
hardest on woman, on account of her pecuniary dependence, and general
subordination to man.</p>

<p>A woman, every reader will understand, would find it impossible to free
herself from her obligations, like the men referred to in the text; nor is it
desirable that she should <em>free herself</em>, but that the law should free her.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_39_39" id="Footnote_39_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> In reprinting for his collected works Mrs. Mill's article on "The Enfranchisement
of Women," Mr. Mill more lately says, "All the more recent of these
papers were the joint production of myself, and one whose loss, even in a
merely intellectual point of view, can never be repaired or alleviated. But the
following essay is hers in a peculiar sense; my share in it being little more
than that of editor or amanuensis. Its authorship having been known at the
time, and publicly attributed to her, it is proper to state, that she never regarded
it as a complete discussion of the subject which it treats of; and, highly
as I estimate it, I would rather it remained unacknowledged, than that it
should be read with the idea, that even the faintest image can be found in it
of a mind and heart, which, in their union of the rarest, and what are deemed
the most conflicting excellences, were unparalleled in any human being that
I have known or read of. While she was the light, life, and grace of every
society in which she took part, the foundation of her character was a deep
seriousness, resulting from the combination of the strongest and most sensitive
feelings with the highest principles. All that excites admiration, when
found separately, in others, seemed brought together in her,&mdash;a conscience at
once healthy and tender; a generosity bounded only by a sense of justice,
which often forgot its own claims, but never those of others; a heart so large
and loving, that whoever was capable of making the smallest return of sympathy
always received tenfold; and, in the intellectual department, a vigor
and truth of imagination, a delicacy of perception, an accuracy and nicety of
observation, only equalled by her profundity of speculative thought, and by
a practical judgment and discernment next to infallible. So elevated was the
general level of her faculties, that the highest poetry, philosophy, oratory, or
art, seemed trivial by the side of her, and equal only to expressing some part
of her mind; and there is no one of these modes of manifestation in which
she could not easily have taken the highest rank, had not her inclination led
her for the most part to content herself with being the inspirer, prompter, and
unavowed co-adjutor, of others.</p>

<p>"The present paper was written to promote a cause which she had deeply
at heart; and, though appealing only to the severest reason, was meant for the
general reader. The question, in her opinion, was in a stage in which no
treatment but the most calmly argumentative could be useful; while many of
the strongest arguments were necessarily omitted, as being unsuited for popular
effect. Had she lived to write out all her thoughts on this great question,
she would have produced something as far transcending in profundity the
present essay, as, had she not placed a rigid restraint upon her feelings, she
would have excelled it in fervid eloquence.</p>

<p>"Yet nothing that even she could have written on any single subject would
have given an adequate idea of the depth and compass of her mind. As, during
life, she detected, before any one else had seemed to perceive them, those
changes of time and circumstances, which, ten or twelve years later, became
subjects of general remark; so I venture to prophesy, that, if mankind continue
to improve, their spiritual history for ages to come will be the progressive
working out of her thoughts, and the realization of her conceptions."</p>

<p>Such tributes, borne by noble men to noble women, are so frequently hidden
away in the heavy volumes which lie out of ordinary reach, that I take
pleasure in bringing them to support my own plea; and I only wish I could
as easily add to that in the text the charming acknowledgments of Alexis de
Tocqueville to his wife.</p></div>

return.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">Chap. 164.&mdash;An Act concerning the Provisions for Widows in certain
Cases.</span></h5>

<blockquote><p><em>Be it enacted, &amp;c., as follows</em>:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sect.</span> 1.&mdash;When a man dies, having lawfully disposed of his estate by will, and
leaving a widow, she may, at any time within six months after the probate of the will,
file in the probate-office, in writing, her waiver of the provisions made for her in the
will; and shall, in such case, be entitled to such portion of his real and personal estate
as she would have been entitled to if her husband had died intestate: <em>provided, however</em>,
that, if the share of the personal estate to which she would thus become entitled
shall exceed the sum of ten thousand dollars, she shall, in such case, be entitled to
receive in her own right the said amount of ten thousand dollars, and to receive the
income only of the excess of said share above said sum of ten thousand dollars during
her natural life. If she makes no such waiver, she shall not be endowed of his lands,
unless it plainly appears by the will to have been the intention of the testator that she
should have such provisions in addition to her dower.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sect.</span> 2.&mdash;Upon application, made by the widow or any one interested in the estate,
the judge of probate may appoint one or more trustees, to receive, hold, and manage,
during the lifetime of the widow, the portion of the personal estate of her deceased
husband, exceeding ten thousand dollars, of which she is entitled to receive under this
act.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sect.</span> 3.&mdash;The twenty-fourth section of the ninety-second chapter of the General
Statutes is hereby repealed.</p>

<p>Approved April 9, 1861.</p></blockquote>

<p>In a case on trial in the Superior Court to-day (Oct. 3, 1861), Chief-Justice
Allen ruled, that the law of 1855, allowing married women to do business on
their own account, separate and apart from their husbands, did not exclude
them from entering into business-partnerships with men other than their husbands.</p></div>

the Rights and Liabilities of Married Women.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Sect.</span> 1 conveys the impression, that all married women may control their
rents and issues of real estate belonging to them at marriage, or separately
received after.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sect.</span> 5, however, says "that this law shall not affect any rights which
may have <em>become</em> vested in any person at the time of its taking effect;"
which, of course, cuts off from its beneficial results all persons previously
married.</p>

<p>It seems a perfectly simple matter to a woman to obviate the difficulties
and disappointments which arise in this way.</p>

<p>Let parties married under the old law, but desiring to benefit by the new,
go before a magistrate, and state their wish; and then let the decision in their
favor be published in the regular way.</p>

<p>Such a method would not benefit parties at variance; but it would benefit
a large class of women engaged, or desiring to engage, in independent
business.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Ohio law repeals a former law of 1857, which secured to all married
women the control of the sale or the disposal of personal property exempt
from execution: so its benefits are of a nature by no means unmixed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_46_46" id="Footnote_46_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46_46"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> This passage was originally prompted by some reflections on the
changes which have occurred in domestic life in Boston.</p>

<p>Here the family, even among those of the highest social rank, had once a
sacred simplicity pleasant to remember. Men were accustomed to take their
three meals with their wives and children. The latest dinner-hour was two,
p.m.; and suppers were unheard of. The evening party began at seven; and
young girls went freely and uninvited from house to house, with their needle
or their book.</p>

<p>How greatly all this is changed, my readers, many of them, feel still
more deeply than I; and, with this change, the formation of "clubs" of various
kinds has brought about others far more important.</p>

<p>A young married lady of rank and fashion was lately lamenting to me
the isolation of husbands and wives, fathers and children, consequent upon
club-life.</p>

<p>"But," she concluded with a sigh, "if my husband had no club, he would
expect a hot supper for a friend two or three times a week; and how could I
ever accomplish that?"</p>

<p>This <em>indolence</em> of <em>women</em> lies at the bottom of many serious social evils.
The woman who will not, health and fortune permitting, make herself responsible
in such a case for any number of hot suppers, deserves to see her own
happiness wither, her own hearth made desolate.</p>

<p>It is needless to add, that if women would educate themselves to be true
and noble companions to their husbands, and resign on their own part all
that is unsound, and therefore unbecoming, in fashionable life, hot suppers
would cease to be a desideratum, and men would pass pleasant evenings
without them.</p></div>

and "The Market" are based on a gold value, and are wholly reliable, I
place no reliance on those furnished in this Appendix. The varying price of
gold, and of the cost of provision and clothing, at the time the tables are
made, are nowhere given, and are important elements in a sound calculation.</p></div>
